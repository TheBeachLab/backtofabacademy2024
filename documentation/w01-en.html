Documenting</h2>
<h3 id="macos-again-how-could-you-sink-so-low">macOS Again? How Could
You Sink So Low?</h3>
<p>Let me see how I can explain this… I’ll explain another day.</p>
<h3 id="colemak">Colemak?</h3>
<p>I never knew how to touch type, even though I always wanted to learn.
While working on the organization of Fab15 in Egypt, I noticed that
Sherry Lassiter has a great skill for typing. At that moment, I decided
to learn. When you learn something from scratch, there’s an advantage -
you have no bad habits. So, I didn’t learn the QWERTY system, which was
originally designed to prevent old typewriters from jamming. I learned
using the <a href="https://colemak.com">Colemak</a> system. Colemak is
designed so that the most frequently used letters in the English
language are on the home row. I have an <a
href="https://drop.com/buy/preonic-mechanical-keyboard">ortho-linear
keyboard</a> to which I’ve applied the Colemak layout, and I practice
about five minutes a day. What I like most about the Colemak layout is
that the backspace key is right next to the <code>A</code> key.</p>
<p><img src="img/w01/preonic.webp" /></p>
<p>I also have <a href="https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org">software on
macOS</a> that changes my keyboard layout to Colemak and also changes
the function of the caps lock key to backspace.</p>
<h3 id="my-text-editor">My Text Editor</h3>
<p>My intention is to use only a command-line text editor. I have some
knowledge of <code>vim</code> and I want to delve deeper. I like the
idea of using only the keyboard to edit text. To avoid the temptation of
using Visual Studio Code, I’ve uninstalled it. The vim text editor is
quite basic by default. Therefore, I’m going to install some plugins.
Here is a list that I will expand over time:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree">NERDTree</a> to have
a sidebar with a file listing, so you can quickly navigate between
files.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ryanoasis/vim-devicons">vim-devicons</a>
to visualize files and folders with small graphic icons.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other useful links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://vimawesome.com">VimAwesome</a> is a page with
hundreds of vim plugins.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/TheBeachLab/myComputing">Fran’s My
Computing repo</a> with some tricks, if you like using the command
line.</li>
</ul>
<h3
id="multi-language-documentation-transcription-with-ai">Multi-language
Documentation Transcription with AI</h3>
<p>Let’s face it. I don’t have much free time and soon I’ll have even
less. So, I need a system to write documentation quickly. I’m going to
try a new technique for documenting that will allow me to have
documentation in two (or more) languages. Right now, most of the text
you’re reading is being dictated in Spanish to my Mac computer.</p>
<p><img src="img/w01/dictation.webp" /></p>
<p>This saves me some time when writing. Some parts, like the code, I
have to write manually. I also have to make corrections manually, for
example, when including links.</p>
<p>This way, I’m generating markdown files with the documentation in
Spanish. The file name contains the week I’m in and the documentation
language. In this case: <code>w01-es.md</code>. I’m going to use an
artificial intelligence to translate the text from that file into
English and save it as <code>w01-en.md</code>. The reason why I’m not
dictating directly in English is that my accent is so bad that the
computer doesn’t understand me. The artificial intelligence model must
be able to recognize Markdown syntax and respect it. It must also
manipulate internal links because links that go <code>w02-es.md</code>
in the Spanish documentation have to be changed to
<code>w02-en.md</code> in the English version of the documentation. As
the model may improve (or even change) throughout the Fab Academy, I’ll
keep the text in Spanish and re-run the translation of all files every
week. I will only edit the original file in Spanish. I will not manually
manipulate the generated translation. So, if what you read in English
doesn’t make sense, blame it on OpenAI or the model I’m using.</p>
<p>I asked César Garcia, from <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/lahoramaker">La Hora Maker</a>, to help me
find a model for the translation. César recommended using the OpenAI
Whisper API, which is capable of translating directly from Spanish
audio. For now, I’m only interested in translation, so I created an
assistant in the OpenAI API with these instructions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Translate the text from Spanish to English, considering nuances and
idioms. Read the entire document to grasp context before translating,
maintaining the original meaning even if not literal. Ignore URLs and
code snippets in the translation; if encountering a markdown link,
translate the text inside square brackets. Modify internal markdown link
URLs to point to the appropriate English file, e.g., change w01-es.md to
w01-en.md. Recognize and retain brands and names without translation.
Capitalize titles in the final text. The style of the translation should
be informal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m changing the instructions from time to time to try to improve the
translation. This page you’re reading has about 1900 tokens. You can
find out how many tokens a text has using the <a
href="https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer">OpenAI Tokenizer</a>. The
cost of the translation is approximately 8 cents, taking into account
that each 1000 tokens cost 0.01 USD for the input and 0.03 USD for the
output. It may seem little, but the cost will increase as Fab Academy
progresses.</p>
<p>On my wish list, I’m still looking for a local model.</p>
<h3 id="automating-the-translation-process">Automating the Translation
Process</h3>
<p>At first, I was using the OpenAI API window. Now I’ve automated this
process using python on the command line. Using a mix of Bing Copilot
and the free version of ChatGPT I asked it to use the OpenAI library to
do the translation. After quite a tug of war (AI doesn’t usually
generate correct code on the first try), I ended up frustrated and
insulting Bing.</p>
<p><img src="img/w01/bing.webp" /></p>
<p>In the end, I had to read the API documentation to make the program
work.</p>
<p>Before translating the pages I have modified I must add them using
<code>git add</code>. Thanks to this, I can limit and control the cost.
Once done, I simply run <code>python translate.py</code> and the script
generates the translated Markdown pages.</p>
<h3
id="automating-the-generation-of-html-and-upload-of-files">Automating
the Generation of HTML and Upload of Files</h3>
<p>I translated a Bash script that I made for the <a
href="https://github.com/Academany/fabzero">FabZero</a> program into
Python. The code converts all <code>.md</code> files into
<code>.html</code> using <a
href="https://pandoc.org/index.html">Pandoc</a>. During conversion, if
it finds a link to a markdown document, it converts it into a link to
its corresponding HTML document using <a
href="../links-to-html.lua">this LUA filter</a>. You can see the script
here: <a href="../auto.py">auto.py</a></p>
<p>The script also automates the git process. So, when I want to upload
my progress I write:</p>
<p><code>python auto.py updating week 1</code></p>
<p>And it converts all the pages to HTML and then uploads everything to
GitHub with the message <code>updating week 1</code>.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>All this is making writing documentation a bit slow at the moment,
and a bit tedious. But I believe that with this system, the speed is
going to increase drastically week by week, and in the end, I’ll be able
to document with great speed and level of detail.</p>
<h2 id="git-that-bottomless-pit">Git: That Bottomless Pit</h2>
<p>Someone might think that because I’ve used git for 10 years, I know
everything there is to know about the version control system. Not at
all. Here are the things I want to improve during this cycle of Fab
Academy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suppress my tendency to upload changes to the main branch. Normally
it’s not a problem, but I have to get used to creating a new branch for
each change.</li>

Documentation Process</h2>
<h3 id="im-using-macos-again-how-did-i-sink-so-low">I’m using macOS
again – How did I sink so low?</h3>
<p>Let’s see how I can explain this… I’ll explain another day.</p>
<h3 id="my-keyboard-is-weird">My Keyboard is Weird</h3>
<p>I never knew how to type properly, although I always wanted to learn.
While working at the Fab15 organization in Egypt, I noticed that Sherry
Lassiter types incredibly fast. That was the moment I decided to learn.
There’s an advantage when you learn something from scratch; you don’t
have any bad habits. So, I didn’t learn the QWERTY system, which was
originally designed to prevent typewriters from jamming. Instead, I
learned the <a href="https://colemak.com">Colemak</a> system. Colemak is
designed so that the most used letters in the English language are on
the home row. I have an <a
href="https://drop.com/buy/preonic-mechanical-keyboard">ortholinear
keyboard</a> on which I’ve applied the Colemak layout, and I practice
about five minutes a day. What I like most about Colemak is that the
backspace key is to the left of the ‘A’ key.</p>
<p><img src="img/w01/preonic.webp" /></p>
<p>I also have <a href="https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org">macOS
software</a> that changes my keyboard layout to Colemak and also swaps
the function of the caps lock key for backspace.</p>
<h3 id="my-text-editor-is-also-weird">My Text Editor is Also Weird</h3>
<p>My intention is to use only a command-line text editor. I know a bit
about <code>vim</code> and I want to get deeper into it. I love the idea
of using only the keyboard for text editing. To avoid the temptation of
using Visual Studio Code, I’ve uninstalled it. The vim text editor is
quite sparse by default. So, I’m going to install some plugins. This is
a list that I will expand over time:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree">NERDTree</a> for
having a sidebar with file listings, allowing me to quickly navigate
between files.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ryanoasis/vim-devicons">vim-devicons</a>
to visualize files and folders with small graphical icons.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other useful links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://vimawesome.com">VimAwesome</a> is a page with
hundreds of vim plugins.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/TheBeachLab/myComputing">Fran’s My
Computing repo</a> with some tips, if you like using the command
line.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="multi-language-documentation-with-ai.">Multi-language
Documentation with AI.</h3>
<p>I need to be realistic. I don’t have much free time, and soon I’ll
have even less. So, I need a system to write documentation efficiently.
I’m going to try a new technique for documenting that will allow me to
have documentation in two (or more) languages. Right now, most of the
text you’re reading is being dictated in Spanish to my Mac.</p>
<p><img src="img/w01/dictation.webp" /></p>
<p>This saves me some time when it comes to writing. Some parts, like
the code, I have to type manually. I also have to make manual
corrections, for example, when including links.</p>
<p>This way, I’m generating Markdown files with the documentation in
Spanish. The file name for each week encodes the week I’m in and the
language of the documentation. In this case: <code>w01-es.md</code>. The
problem is that the documentation has to be in English. The reason why I
don’t dictate directly in English is that my accent is so bad that the
computer does not understand me. To solve that problem, I’m going to use
artificial intelligence to translate the text of that file into English
and also into German. I will save the files as <code>w01-en.md</code>
and <code>w01-de.md</code> respectively. The artificial intelligence
model has to be capable of recognizing Markdown syntax and being able to
respect it. It will also have to manipulate internal links, because
links going to <code>w02-es.md</code> in the Spanish documentation have
to be changed to <code>w02-en.md</code> in the English version of the
documentation. It’s possible that the model improves (or even changes)
throughout Fab Academy. That’s why I’ll keep the text in Spanish and
re-run the translation of all files each week. I will only edit the
original file in Spanish. I will not manually manipulate the generated
translation. So, if what you read in English or German doesn’t make
sense, blame OpenAI or whatever model I’m using.</p>
<p>I asked César Garcia, from <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/lahoramaker">La Hora Maker</a>, to help me
find a model for translation. César recommended using OpenAI’s Whisper
API, capable of translating directly from Spanish audio. For now, I’m
only interested in translation, so I’ve created an assistant in the
OpenAI API with these instructions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Translate the text from Spanish to English, Read the entire document
to grasp context before translating it, take into account nuances and
idioms of the Spanish language and translate them to the equivalents in
English. The translation should not be literal, focus on maintaining the
original meaning and provide a translation that makes sense in English.
Ignore external URLs and code snippets in the translation; if
encountering a markdown link, translate the text inside square brackets.
Modify internal markdown link URLs to point to the appropriate English
file, e.g., change w01-es.md to w01-en.md. Recognize and retain brands
and names without translation. Use correct grammar and syntax in the
final text. The style of the translation should be informal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have another model in German with similar instructions. I’ve been
changing the instructions now and then, trying to improve the
translation.</p>
<p>This page you’re reading has about 3600 tokens. You can find out how
many tokens a text has using the <a
href="https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer">OpenAI Tokenizer</a>. The
cost to translate this page into two languages is approximately 0.29
USD, considering that each 1000 tokens cost 0.01 USD for the input and
0.03 USD for the output. It seems quite expensive, and the cost will
increase as Fab Academy progresses. For that reason, I’ll only translate
contents when I consider the work advanced.</p>
<p>In my wishlist, I’ll keep looking for a local model. That way, I
could translate contents more frequently. For now, I’ve been testing the
<code>Phi 2</code> and <code>Yarn Mistral</code> models with disastrous
results.</p>
<h3 id="automating-the-translation-process">Automating the Translation
Process</h3>
<p>At first, I was using the OpenAI API window. Now I’ve automated this
process using Python on the command line. Using a mix of Bing Copilot
and the free version of ChatGPT, I requested a program that automates
translation using the OpenAI library. But it didn’t go well. After quite
a bit of back and forth (AI doesn’t usually generate correct code on the
first try), I ended up frustrated and insulting Bing.</p>
<p><img src="img/w01/bing.webp" /></p>
<p>In the end, I had to read the API documentation to make the program
work.</p>
<p>To avoid unnecessary costs, the script only translates Spanish
Markdown files that I’ve added using <code>git add</code>. Thanks to
this, I can control the cost. Once done, I simply run
<code>python translate-en.py</code> and the script generates the
Markdown pages translated into English. I do the same for German.</p>
<p>In reality, I usually don’t do the translation separately because
I’ve included it in the next step.</p>
<h3
id="automating-the-generation-of-html-and-uploading-files">Automating
the Generation of HTML and Uploading Files</h3>
<p>Fab Academy documentation must be presented in the form of a web
page. To generate HTML pages from the markdown files, I’ve converted a
Bash script that I made for the educational program <a
href="https://github.com/Academany/fabzero">FabZero</a> to Python. The
code converts all <code>.md</code> files into <code>.html</code> using
<a href="https://pandoc.org/index.html">Pandoc</a> with a <a
href="base.css">CSS style template</a>. During conversion, if it finds a
link to a markdown document, it converts it into a link to its
corresponding HTML document using <a href="../links-to-html.lua">this
LUA filter</a>.</p>
<p>Optionally, the script also automates the translations to English and
German and the uploading of files to Github. So, when I want to upload
my progress I write:</p>
<p><code>python auto.py --translate updating week 1</code></p>
<p>And that way, the script translates the pages if it finds
<code>--translate</code> among the arguments. It also converts all pages
to HTML and then uploads everything to Github as long as there’s a
message, which in this case is <code>updating week 1</code>. If there’s
no message, none of the processes related to git are performed.</p>
<p>You can check the script here: <a href="../auto.py">auto.py</a></p>
<h3 id="using-cicd-in-github-to-serve-web-pages">Using CI/CD in Github
to Serve Web Pages</h3>
<p>Let’s see what I have so far on Github:</p>
<ul>
<li>My original <code>.md</code> files in Spanish</li>
<li>The AI-translated <code>.md</code> files in English and German</li>
<li>The <code>.html</code> pages of all <code>.md</code> files generated
by Pandoc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only thing left now is a web server. And you can do that from
Github by accessing the repository settings.</p>
<p><img src="img/w01/cicd.webp" /></p>
<p>This will create a file in <code>.github/workflows/static.yml</code>,
which I only had to modify the <code>runner</code>, because
<code>runs-on: ubuntu-latest</code> didn’t work. I changed it to
<code>runs-on: ubuntu-22.04</code> and upon committing, the pages were
automatically served.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>All of this is making writing documentation a bit slow at the moment,
and a bit tedious. But I believe with this system, <strong>the speed is
going to increase drastically week by week</strong> and in the end, I’ll
be able to document quickly and with great detail.</p>
<p>Additionally, I believe this method will <strong>help</strong> many
people who cannot <strong>express their talent</strong> because they
don’t master another language. It’s unfair that should happen and I hope
AI helps people to show how valuable they are.</p>
<h2 id="git-that-bottomless-pit">Git: That Bottomless Pit</h2>
<p>Someone might think that because I’ve been using git for 10 years, I
know everything there is to know about this version control system. Not
at all. These are the things I want to improve during this cycle of Fab
Academy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suppress my tendency to push changes to the main branch. Normally
it’s not a problem, but I need to get used to creating a new branch for
each change.</li>
<li><del>Steal</del> Get inspired by <a
href="http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/project_management/archive.html">Neil’s
aliases</a> to execute git commands more quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p>(I might add more things throughout Fab Academy…)</p>
<h2 id="project-management">Project Management</h2>
<p>I’d like to explain how I manage my projects. When you don’t have a
boss, and nobody tells you what to do, you need to be very disciplined.
Otherwise, you might fall into a negative spiral.</p>
<p>The most important thing is <strong>knowing where you’re
going</strong>. Because if you don’t, you have a very serious problem.
Sometimes you’ll find yourself lost in Fab Academy (and in life). You
won’t know what you want to do, you won’t feel like doing anything, and
it seems like you’re moving in slow motion while the world speeds by. In
those moments, remember <a href="https://www.thetoolsbook.com">Phil
Stutz</a>. Invest in yourself: Exercise, reconnect with others, write
your memories in a journal. It helps me and I’m convinced it will help
you too. Soon, you’ll see your North Star. Set course for it.</p>
<p>The second is <strong>learning to reduce and simplify</strong>. One
of your biggest problems in Fab Academy will be something like this: You
can’t find a photo you’re sure you had. You don’t know if it’s on your
phone’s photos, in Google Drive, or on a USB drive, if you transferred
it to your computer, or someone sent it to you on WhatsApp… Simplify.
Reduce.</p>
<p>And lastly, and I believe most importantly, the real secret to
achieving anything, no matter how difficult, is to progress by taking
<strong>many small steps</strong>. You solve one small problem, then
another, and then another one. That’s how it works.</p>
<p>As for tools to help you manage, I’ve tried a few. So, I’ll start
with the ones that don’t work for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sticky notes on the wall. The idea is good. Very visual and agile.
But it has two problems. First problem: In Barcelona, it often gets very
hot and the notes fall down. Second problem: If I can’t see the wall,
there’s no project.</li>
<li>Kanban software and similar. They try to resemble sticky notes. I
don’t use them because: They seem complicated and don’t let me
draw.</li>
<li>Microsoft Project and similar. No comment.</li>
<li>Web services like Notion.com, Monday.com, and similar. If nobody
assures me that I’m going to live 350 years, I refuse to spend a second
of my short life trying to understand how a service that only looks easy
on TikTok and might close down tomorrow afternoon works.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I’m using a combination of plain text for long-term goals,
reminders for medium-term goals, and Apple’s Freeform for tasks I’m
going to do today. Freeform is an infinite canvas program, similar to <a
href="https://miro.com">Miro</a>. It has the advantages of sticky notes
without their drawbacks. I can customize it and create my own system.
For example, I’ve created the <code>DOING NOW</code> box where only one
note fits. For me, this is important because I can only do one thing at
a time. I can also draw by hand and I like that. I will probably make a
video explaining everything in more detail.</p>

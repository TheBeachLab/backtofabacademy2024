<h3 id="macos-again-how-could-you-fall-so-low">macOS again? How could
you fall so low?</h3>
<p>Let’s see how I explain this… I’ll explain another day.</p>
<h3 id="colemak">Colemak?</h3>
<p>I never knew how to type, though I always wanted to learn. While
working on the organization of Fab15 in Egypt, I noticed that Sherry
Lassiter has a great ability for typing. At that moment, I decided to
learn. There’s an advantage when you learn something from scratch, and
that is that you have no bad habits. So, I didn’t learn the QWERTY
system, which was originally designed to prevent the keys of old
typewriters from jamming. I learned the <a
href="https://colemak.com">Colemak</a> system instead. Colemak is
designed so that the most used letters in the English language are on
the home row. I have an <a
href="https://drop.com/buy/preonic-mechanical-keyboard">ortholinear
keyboard</a> to which I’ve applied the Colemak layout, and I practice
about five minutes a day. What I like most about the Colemak
distribution is that the backspace key is next to the <code>A</code>
key.</p>
<p><img src="img/w01/preonic.webp" /></p>
<p>I also have a <a href="https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org">software
on macOS</a> that changes my keyboard layout to Colemak and also swaps
the function of the caps lock key with backspace.</p>
<h3 id="my-text-editor">My Text Editor</h3>
<p>My intention is to use only a command-line text editor. I have some
knowledge of <code>vim</code> and I want to deepen my learning. I like
the idea of using only the keyboard to edit text. To avoid the
temptation of using Visual Studio Code, I have uninstalled it. The vim
text editor is quite sparse by default. Therefore, I’m going to install
some plugins. Here is a list that I will expand over time:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree">NERDTree</a> to have
a sidebar with the listing of files, allowing me to navigate quickly
between files.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ryanoasis/vim-devicons">vim-devicons</a>
to visualize files and folders with a small graphic icon.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other useful links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://vimawesome.com">VimAwesome</a> is a website with
hundreds of vim plugins</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/TheBeachLab/myComputing">Fran’s My
Computing repo</a> with some tricks, if you like using the command
line.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="multi-language-documentation-with-ai.">Multi-Language
Documentation with AI.</h3>
<p>Let’s face it. I don’t have much free time and, soon, I’ll have even
less. So, I need a system to write documentation efficiently. I’m going
to try a new documentation technique that will allow me to have the
documentation in two (or more) languages. Right now, most of the text
you’re reading is being dictated in Spanish to my Mac.</p>
<p><img src="img/w01/dictation.webp" /></p>
<p>This saves me some time when writing. Some parts, like the code, I
have to type manually. I also have to make corrections manually, for
example, when including links.</p>
<p>In this way, I’m generating markdown files with the documentation in
Spanish. The reason I don’t dictate directly in English is that my
accent is so bad that the computer can’t understand me. The filename of
each week contains the week I’m in and the language of the
documentation. In this case: <code>w01-es.md</code>. I’m going to use
artificial intelligence to translate the text of that file into English
and German and save it as <code>w01-en.md</code> and
<code>w01-de.md</code>, respectively. The artificial intelligence model
has to be able to recognize Markdown syntax and be able to respect it.
It will also have to manipulate internal links, because links going to
<code>w02-es.md</code> in the Spanish documentation have to be changed
to <code>w02-en.md</code> in the English version of the documentation.
As the model may improve (or even change) throughout Fab Academy, I’ll
keep the text in Spanish and rerun the translation of all files every
week. I will only edit the original file in Spanish. I will not manually
manipulate the generated translation. So, if what you read in English or
German doesn’t make sense, blame it on OpenAI or the model I’m
using.</p>
<p>I asked César Garcia, from <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/lahoramaker">La Hora Maker</a>, to help me
find a model for translation. César recommended using OpenAI’s Whisper
API, which is capable of translating directly from Spanish audio. For
now, I’m only interested in translation, so I created an assistant in
the OpenAI API with these instructions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Translate the text from Spanish to English, considering nuances and
idioms. Read the entire document to grasp context before translating,
maintaining the original meaning even if not literal. Ignore URLs and
code snippets in the translation; if encountering a markdown link,
translate the text inside square brackets. Modify internal markdown link
URLs to point to the appropriate English file, e.g., change w01-es.md to
w01-en.md. Recognize and retain brands and names without translation.
Capitalize titles in the final text. The style of the translation should
be informal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s a different model for German with analogous instructions. I
keep changing the instructions from time to time to try to improve the
translation.</p>
<p>This page you’re reading has about 2000 tokens. You can know how many
tokens a text has using the <a
href="https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer">OpenAI Tokenizer</a>. The
cost of translation is approximately 8 cents per dollar, considering
that each 1000 tokens costs 0.01 USD for input and 0.03 USD for output.
It may seem little, but the cost will rise as Fab Academy
progresses.</p>
<p>It’s on my wishlist to keep looking for a local model.</p>
<h3 id="automating-the-translation-process">Automating the Translation
Process</h3>
<p>Initially, I was using the OpenAI API window. Now, I’ve automated
this process using python in the command line. Using a mix of Bing
Copilot and the free version of ChatGPT, I asked it to use the OpenAI
library to perform the translation. After quite a bit of back and forth
(AI doesn’t usually generate correct code at first), I ended up
frustrated and insulting Bing.</p>
<p><img src="img/w01/bing.webp" /></p>
<p>In the end, I had to read the API documentation to make the program
work.</p>
<p>Before translating the pages I have modified, I must add them using
<code>git add</code>. Thanks to this, I can limit and control the cost.
Once done, I simply execute <code>python translate-en.py</code> and the
script generates the Markdown pages translated into English. I do the
same for German.</p>
<h3 id="automating-html-generation-and-file-upload">Automating HTML
Generation and File Upload</h3>
<p>I’ve translated a script from Bash into Python that I made for the <a
href="https://github.com/Academany/fabzero">FabZero</a> program. The
code converts all <code>.md</code> files into <code>.html</code> using
<a href="https://pandoc.org/index.html">Pandoc</a>. During conversion,
if it finds a link to a markdown document, it converts it into a link to
its corresponding HTML document using <a
href="../links-to-html.lua">this LUA filter</a>. You can see the script
here: <a href="../auto.py">auto.py</a></p>
<p>The script also automates the git process. So, when I want to upload
my progress, I type:</p>
<p><code>python auto.py updating week 1</code></p>
<p>And that converts all the pages to HTML and then uploads everything
to Github with the message <code>updating week 1</code>.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>All of this is making the documentation process a bit slow at this
point, and somewhat tedious. But I believe that with this system, the
speed is going to dramatically increase week by week, and in the end, I
will be able to document with great speed and level of detail.</p>
<h2 id="git-that-bottomless-pit">Git: That Bottomless Pit</h2>
<p>Someone might think that since I’ve been using git for 10 years, I
already know everything there is to know about the version control
system. Not at all. Here are the things I want to improve during this
cycle of Fab Academy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suppress my tendency to upload changes to the main branch. Normally
nothing happens but I have to get used to creating a new branch for each
change.</li>

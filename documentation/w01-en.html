Documenting</h2>
<h3 id="macos-again-how-could-you-stoop-so-low">macOS again? How could
you stoop so low?</h3>
<p>Let me try to explain this… I’ll explain another day.</p>
<h3 id="colemak">Colemak?</h3>
<p>I never knew how to touch type, although I always wanted to learn.
While working on the organization of Fab15 in Egypt, I noticed that
Sherry Lassiter is extremely proficient at typing. At that point, I
decided to learn. There’s an advantage when you learn something from
scratch - you have no bad habits. So, I didn’t learn the QWERTY system,
which was originally designed to keep old typewriters from jamming. I
learned using the <a href="https://colemak.com">Colemak</a> system
instead. Colemak is designed so that the most frequently used letters in
English are on the home row. I have an <a
href="https://drop.com/buy/preonic-mechanical-keyboard">ortholinear
keyboard</a> which I’ve set up with the Colemak layout, and I practice
about five minutes a day. What I like most about the Colemak layout is
that the backspace key is right next to the <code>A</code> key.</p>
<p><img src="img/w01/preonic.webp" /></p>
<p>I also have <a href="https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org">software on
macOS</a> that changes my keyboard layout to Colemak and also switches
the caps lock key function to backspace.</p>
<h3 id="my-text-editor">My Text Editor</h3>
<p>I intend to use only a command-line text editor. I know a bit of
<code>vim</code> and want to deepen my learning. I like the idea of
using only the keyboard to edit text. To avoid the temptation of using
Visual Studio Code, I’ve uninstalled it. The vim text editor is quite
sparse in its original form. Because of this, I will install some
plugins. This is a list that I will expand over time:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree">NERDTree</a> to have
a sidebar with a list of files, so I can quickly navigate between
them.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ryanoasis/vim-devicons">vim-devicons</a>
to visualize files and folders with a small graphic icon.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other useful links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://vimawesome.com">VimAwesome</a> is a webpage with
hundreds of vim plugins</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/TheBeachLab/myComputing">Fran’s My
Computing repo</a> with some tricks, if you like using the command
line.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="multi-language-documentation-with-ai">Multi-language
Documentation with AI</h3>
<p>Let’s be realistic. I don’t have much free time, and soon, I’ll have
even less. So, I need a system for documenting efficiently. I’m going to
try a new technique for documenting that will allow me to have the
documentation in two (or more) languages. Right now, most of the text
you’re reading is being dictated in Spanish to my Mac computer.</p>
<p><img src="img/w01/dictation.webp" /></p>
<p>This saves me some time when writing. Some parts, like the code, I
have to type manually. I also have to do manual corrections, for
example, when including links.</p>
<p>This way, I’m generating markdown files with documentation in
Spanish. The reason why I’m not dictating directly in English is that my
accent is so bad that the computer doesn’t understand me. The name of
the file for each week contains coded the week I’m in and the language
of the documentation. In this case: <code>w01-es.md</code>. I’m going to
use artificial intelligence to translate the text of that file into
English and German and save it as <code>w01-en.md</code> and
<code>w01-de.md</code>, respectively. The AI model has to be capable of
recognizing Markdown syntax and preserving it. It also has to handle
internal links, because the links that go to <code>w02-es.md</code> in
the Spanish documentation have to be changed to <code>w02-en.md</code>
in the English version of the documentation. As the model might improve
(or even change) throughout Fab Academy, I will keep the text in Spanish
and rerun the translation of all files every week. I will only edit the
original file in Spanish. I won’t manually manipulate the generated
translation. So, if what you read in English or German doesn’t make
sense, blame OpenAI or whichever model I’m using.</p>
<p>I asked César Garcia, from <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/lahoramaker">La Hora Maker</a>, for help
in finding a model for translation. César recommended using OpenAI’s
Whisper API, which is capable of translating directly from audio in
Spanish. For now, I’m only interested in the translation, so I created
an assistant in the OpenAI API with these instructions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Translate the text from Spanish to English, Read the entire document
to grasp context before translating it, take into account nuances and
idioms of the Spanish language and translate them to the equivalents in
English. The translation should not be literal, focus on maintaining the
original meaning and provide a translation that makes sense in English.
Ignore external URLs and code snippets in the translation; if
encountering a markdown link, translate the text inside square brackets.
Modify internal markdown link URLs to point to the appropriate English
file, e.g., change w01-es.md to w01-en.md. Recognize and retain brands
and names without translation. Use correct grammar and syntax in the
final text. The style of the translation should be informal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s another model for German with similar instructions. I change
the instructions now and then to try to improve the translation.</p>
<p>This page you’re reading has about 2000 tokens. You can find out how
many tokens a text has using the <a
href="https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer">OpenAI Tokenizer</a>. The
cost of translation is approximately 8 cents of a dollar, considering
that every 1000 tokens cost 0.01 USD for the input and 0.03 USD for the
output. It might seem little, but the cost will rise as Fab Academy
progresses.</p>
<p>On my wishlist, I will continue looking for a local model.</p>
<h3 id="automating-the-translation-process">Automating the Translation
Process</h3>
<p>At first, I was using the OpenAI API window. Now, I’ve automated this
process using python on the command line. Using a mix of Bing Copilot
and the free version of ChatGPT, I asked them to use the OpenAI library
for translation. After a lot of back and forth (AI doesn’t usually
generate correct code on the first try), I ended up frustrated and
cursing out Bing.</p>
<p><img src="img/w01/bing.webp" /></p>
<p>In the end, I had to read the API documentation to make the program
work.</p>
<p>Before translating pages that I’ve modified I must add them using
<code>git add</code>. Thanks to that, I can limit and control the cost.
Once that’s done, I simply run <code>python translate-en.py</code>, and
the script generates the Markdown pages translated into English. I do
the same for German.</p>
<p>Normally, I don’t perform this step in isolation because I’ve
included it in the next step.</p>
<h3 id="automating-html-generation-and-file-upload">Automating HTML
Generation and File Upload</h3>
<p>The Fab Academy documentation has to be presented in web page form.
To generate HTML pages from markdown files, I translated a script from
Bash language that I made for the <a
href="https://github.com/Academany/fabzero">FabZero</a> program to
Python. The code converts all <code>.md</code> files to
<code>.html</code> using <a
href="https://pandoc.org/index.html">Pandoc</a> with a <a
href="base.css">CSS style template</a>. During conversion, if it finds a
link to a markdown document, it converts it to a link to its
corresponding HTML document using <a href="../links-to-html.lua">this
LUA filter</a>.</p>
<p>The script also automates the translation from the previous section
and the file upload to Github optionally. So, when I want to upload my
progress, I write:</p>
<p><code>python auto.py --translate updating week 1</code></p>
<p>And thus, the script translates the pages if it finds
<code>--translate</code> among the arguments. It also converts all pages
to HTML and then uploads everything to Github as long as there is a
message, in this case, it is <code>updating week 1</code>. If there is
no message, it doesn’t perform any of the git-related processes.</p>
<p>You can see the script here: <a href="../auto.py">auto.py</a></p>
<h3 id="using-cdci-in-github-to-serve-web-pages">Using CD/CI in Github
to Serve Web Pages</h3>
<p>Let’s see what I have so far on Github:</p>
<ul>
<li>My original <code>.md</code> files in Spanish</li>
<li>The <code>.md</code> files translated by AI into English and
German</li>
<li>The <code>.html</code> pages for all the <code>.md</code> files
generated by Pandoc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only thing missing now is a web server. And you can do this from
Github by accessing the repository settings.</p>
<p><img src="img/w01/cicd.webp" /></p>
<p>This will create a file in <code>.github/workflows/static.yml</code>,
from which I only had to modify the <code>runner</code>, because
<code>runs-on: ubuntu-latest</code> didn’t work. I changed it to
<code>runs-on: ubuntu-22.04</code> and upon making a
<code>commit</code>, the pages were automatically served.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>All of this is making writing documentation somewhat slow at this
moment, and a bit tedious. But I believe that with this system, the
speed will increase drastically week by week, and in the end, I’ll be
able to document quickly and in great detail.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I believe this method will help many people who can’t
express their talent because they don’t speak another language. It’s
unfair for that to happen, and I hope AI helps people demonstrate how
valuable they are.</p>
<h2 id="git-that-bottomless-pit">Git: That Bottomless Pit</h2>
<p>Someone might think that because I’ve been using git for 10 years I
know everything there is to know about the version control system. Far
from it. Here are the things I want to improve during this Fab Academy
cycle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suppressing my tendency to push changes to the main branch. Usually,
it doesn’t matter, but I need to get used to creating a new branch for
each change.</li>
</ul>

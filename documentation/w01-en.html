<h2 id="reinventing-the-way-of-documenting">Reinventing the Way of
Documenting</h2>
<h3 id="transcribing-multi-language-documentation-with-ai.">Transcribing
Multi-Language Documentation with AI.</h3>
<p>Let’s face it. I don’t have much free time and soon, I will have even
less. Thus, I need a system to write documentation efficiently. I am
going to try a new technique for documenting that will allow me to have
the documentation in two (or more) languages. Currently, most of the
text you are reading is being dictated in Spanish to my Mac
computer.</p>
<p><img src="img/w01/dictation.webp" /></p>
<p>This saves me some time when writing. Some parts, like code, I have
to type manually. I also have to manually make corrections, for example,
when I include links.</p>
<p>This way, I am generating markdown files with the documentation in
Spanish. The filename includes coded the week I am in and the language
of the documentation. In this case: <code>w01-es.md</code>. I am going
to use artificial intelligence to translate the text from that file into
English and save it as <code>w01-en.md</code>. The reason why I do not
dictate directly in English is that my accent is so bad that the
computer does not understand me. The AI model has to be capable of
recognizing the Markdown syntax and be able to respect it. It will also
have to manipulate the internal links, because links going to
<code>w02-es.md</code> in the Spanish documentation have to be changed
to <code>w02-en.md</code> in the English version of the documentation.
As it is possible that the model will improve (or even change)
throughout Fab Academy, I will keep the text in Spanish and re-run the
translation of all files every week. I will only edit the original file
in Spanish. I will not manually manipulate the generated translation.
So, if what you read in English does not make sense, blame OpenAI or the
model I am using.</p>
<p>I asked César Garcia, from <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/lahoramaker">La Hora Maker</a>, to help me
find a model for the translation. César recommended using the OpenAI
Whisper API, which is capable of translating directly from audio in
Spanish. For now, I am only interested in the translation, so I’ve
created an assistant in the OpenAI API with these instructions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are an expert translator from Spanish to English. You know the
nuances, and idioms of the Spanish language and translate them into the
appropriate idioms of the English language. You ignore URLs in the
translations. If you find a markdown link, you translate the text inside
the square brackets if necessary. You will modify the internal URL of
the markdown link so that it points to the appropriate markdown file in
English. For example, you will change a markdown link that points to
w01-es.md to make it point to w01-en.md. But remember, you will only do
that for the markdown links. You can recognize brands and names so that
you avoid translating them. You will also fix the original text by
capitalizing titles and fixing any other syntax or grammar error before
translating it. You deliver the answers in code rather than rendering
the markdown in HTML, so that I can copy the markdown syntax.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Translating this page you are reading has cost me about 2000 tokens.
You can find out how many tokens the translation will cost you using the
<a href="https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer">OpenAI
Tokenizer</a>.</p>
<p>At first, I was using the OpenAI API window. Now, I have automated
this process using the command line. Using <a href="">Bing Copilot</a>,
I have transformed a Bash script that I made for the <a
href="">FabZero</a> program into Python and asked it to use the OpenAI
library to perform the translation. After a bit of back and forth (AI
does not usually generate correct code on the first attempt), Bing has
generated a script that works. You can see the script here: <a
href="auto.py">auto.py</a></p>
<p>On my wish list, I will continue searching for a model that is local.
I do not want to use a web service.</p>
<h3 id="text-editor">Text Editor</h3>
<p>My intention is to use only a text editor in the command line. I have
some knowledge of vim and I want to deepen my learning. I like the idea
of using only the keyboard to edit text. To avoid the temptation of
using Visual Studio Code, I have uninstalled it. The vim text editor is
quite spare by origin. Therefore, I am going to install some plugins.
This is a list that I will expand over time:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree">NERDTree</a> to have
a sidebar with a list of files, so that I can quickly navigate between
files.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ryanoasis/vim-devicons">vim-devicons</a>
to visualize files and folders with small graphic icons.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Other useful links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://vimawesome.com">VimAwesome</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/TheBeachLab/myComputing">Fran’s My
Computing repo</a> with some tricks, if you like using the command
line.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="keyboard-layout">Keyboard Layout</h3>
<p>I never knew how to type, but I always wanted to learn. At Fab15 in
Egypt, I noticed Sherry Lassiter, who has great typing skills. At that
moment, I decided to learn. There is an advantage when you learn
something late, and that is you have no bad habits. So, I did not learn
the QWERTY system. I learned directly the <a
href="https://colemak.com">Colemak</a> system. I have an <a
href="https://drop.com/buy/preonic-mechanical-keyboard">ortholinear
keyboard</a>, and I practice about five minutes a day. I also have a <a
href="https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org">software on macOS</a> that
changes my keyboard layout and also changes the function of the caps
lock key to backspace.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>All of this is making writing the documentation a bit slow at this
moment, and a bit tedious. But I believe that with this system, the
speed will drastically increase week by week and in the end, I will be
able to document with great speed and level of detail.</p>
<h2 id="git-that-bottomless-pit">Git: That Bottomless Pit</h2>
<p>Someone might think that because I have been using git for 10 years I
know everything there is to know about the version control system. Not
at all. These are the things I want to improve during this Fab Academy
cycle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Curb my tendency to push changes to the main branch. Normally
nothing happens but I have to get used to creating a new branch for each
change.</li>
</ul>

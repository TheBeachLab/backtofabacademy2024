# About me
My name is Fran Sanchez, I am the founder of [The (fabulous) Beach Lab](http://beachlab.org), a personal and Mobile Fab Lab based in Sitges, Spain. I am a Civil Engineer with multiple passions: I love adventures and exploration so I enjoy overlanding away from civilization. To gain some more range of movement I became a sailor, then a diver, followed by becoming a pilot. I also became Ham Radio Operator (EA3IRP) to meet people who are not taped to their "smart"phones. I am hesitating between submarines and helicopters for my next move. I also love Unix-like Computing (anything that runs on a terminal), Art and Science. Yeah, all this is very nice, but I wasn't making any money, so I became Apple Developer and now I also develop awesome apps for iOS devices. But I am not making any money either. Check out my travel Swiss Army knife app, [Hariburi](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hariburi/id1599749190)!

Final Project

## Expectations vs Reality

These are my goals and expectations for this course.

### Expectations (written on January 19)
- I look forward to exploring the bleeding edge in each assignment.
- Since this is my second iteration of Fab Academy, I expect the outcome of each assignment to be a product.
- I want to de-rust my structural engineering, fluid mechanics, and differential geometry knowledge and put them into practice.
- I expect to be able to create or modify an AI model to generate some parts of the assignments.
- I hope to be able to complete a bit ambitious final project that I had in mind for some time now.

I just re-read my expectations, and I already regret it. But I am committed to not changing them.

### Reality (to be written on June 5)

- Placeholder for a long list of miserable failures.

Fran’s Fab Academy 2024 Chronicles from the
<code>Pirate Node</code></h2>
<h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Fran Sanchez, I’m the founder of <a
href="http://beachlab.org">The (fabulous) Beach Lab</a>, a personal and
mobile Fab Lab based in Sitges, Spain. I’m a Civil Engineer with a wide
range of passions: I love adventures and explorations, which is why I
enjoy overlanding far from civilization. To extend my range of motion, I
became a ship captain, then a diver, and finally a pilot. I’m also a Ham
Radio Operator (EA3IRP) to meet people who aren’t glued to their
“smartphones” all day long. I’m torn between submarines and helicopters
for my next adventure. I also love Unix-type computers (anything that
runs in a terminal), Art, and Science. Yes, all of this sounds great,
but it wasn’t making me money, so I also became an Apple developer, and
now I develop applications in Swift/SwiftUI for iOS devices. But I’m
still not making money. Check out my travel utility, <a

<h2 id="expectations-vs-reality">Expectations vs Reality</h2>
<p>Here are my goals and expectations for this cycle.</p>
<h3 id="expectations-written-on-january-19">Expectations (written on
January 19)</h3>
<ul>
<li>I’m really looking forward to pushing the boundaries every
week.</li>
<li>Since this is my second run of the Fab Academy, I’m hoping that the
outcome of each week will be a product.</li>
<li>I want to brush off my knowledge in structural engineering, fluid
mechanics, and differential geometry and put it into practice.</li>
<li>I hope to be able to create or modify an AI model to generate some
parts of the tasks.</li>
<li>I hope to complete a somewhat ambitious final project that I’ve had
in mind for some time.</li>
</ul>
<p>I just reread my expectations, and I’m already regretting them. But
I’m committed to not changing them.</p>
<h3 id="reality-to-be-written-on-june-5">Reality (to be written on June
5)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Placeholder for a long list of miserable failures.</li>
</ul>

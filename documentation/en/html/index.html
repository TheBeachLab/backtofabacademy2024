<h1 id="about-me">About me</h1>
<p><span class="smallcaps">My name is Fran Sanchez</span>, I’m the founder of <a href="http://beachlab.org">The (fabulous) Beach Lab</a>, a personal and mobile Fab Lab based in Sitges, Spain. I’m a Civil Engineering graduate with diverse passions: I love adventures and exploration. I often escape to the mountains in a 4x4, far from civilization, whenever I can. In pursuit of gaining a bit more range of motion, I became a ship captain, then a diver, and finally a pilot. I’m also a Radio Amateur Operator (EA3IRP) to meet people who aren’t glued to their “smartphones” all day. I’m debating between submarines or helicopters for my next adventure. I also adore Unix-type computers (anything that runs in a terminal), Art, and Science. Yes, all this is very cool, but I wasn’t making money, so I also became an Apple developer and now I also develop applications in Swift/SwiftUI for iOS devices. But I’m still not making any money.

<h1 id="expectations-vs-reality">Expectations vs Reality</h1>
<p>Here are my goals and expectations for this cycle.</p>
<h2 id="expectations-written-on-january-19">Expectations (written on January 19)</h2>
<ul>
<li>I’m really excited to explore the limits of cutting-edge advancements.</li>
<li>Since this is my second iteration of the Fab Academy, I expect the output of each week to be a product<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">A <em>product</em> understood as something finished enough to potentially hit the market.<br />
<br />
</span></span>.</li>
<li>I want to brush off my knowledge in structural engineering, fluid mechanics, and differential geometry and put it into practice.</li>
<li>I hope to be able to create or modify an AI model to generate some parts of the Fab Academy.</li>
<li>I aim to complete a somewhat ambitious final project that I’ve had in mind for some time now.</li>
</ul>
<p>I just reread my expectations, and I am already regretting them. But I am committed to not keeping them.</p>
<h2 id="reality-well-see-on-june-5">Reality (we’ll see on June 5)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Space reserved for a long list of miserable failures.</li>

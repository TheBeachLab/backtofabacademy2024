<h1 id="characterizing-the-laser-cutter">Characterizing… the laser cutter?</h1>
<p><span class="smallcaps">I would like to have Neil’s laser cutter</span>. <strong>My laser cutter doesn’t have a fixed kerf</strong>. The <em>power</em> and the <em>cutting speed</em> affect the kerf, the <em>material</em> affects the kerf, the <em>thickness</em> of the material affects the kerf, even the <em>color</em><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Dark colors absorb more radiation and are easier to cut<br />
<br />
</span></span> of the material affects the kerf. I have to follow a process to characterize each material with the laser. Although I don’t usually show it in the documentation, I repeat this process every time I change any parameter of the material. It’s a real drag, I know. But skipping these minutes can lead to hours of delays and frustration later on, or even ruin all the work. My free advice of the week:</p>
<center>
<em>spend those minutes</em>
</center>
<p>The first thing I do is search for the optimal cutting or marking parameters. I take a sample<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">5x5 cm is enough<br />
<br />
</span></span> of the material I want to characterize. I place it on the platform and make sure the focus is correct. The idea is to find <em>the lowest possible energy</em><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">It’s a combination of power, speed, number of passes, and frequency, if available. My laser (Full Spectrum 5th gen) doesn’t have frequency control. Whenever possible, I try to keep the speed at maximum. If it’s a material sensitive to heat (like cellular polypropylene) I do more than one pass at low power.<br />
<br />
</span></span> that cuts the material, without deforming or burning it. I make a pattern in Inkscape with copies in different colors and assign a setting to each line. As a starting point, you can use settings from a material and a machine similar to yours. Some machines include a library of materials with predefined cutting settings. I normally start at +5% of the known setting and go down by 5% on each line. The important thing is to note those settings on the same material and save them for future reference. These settings then serve me whenever I want to cut or mark the material.</p>

<p>Only then do I proceed to measure the kerf. But remember, if you change any parameter, that kerf is no longer valid.</p>
<h1 id="cutting-something-on-the-vinyl-cutter">Cutting “something” on the vinyl cutter</h1>
<p><span class="smallcaps">The vinyl cutter is my favorite machine</span>. It’s versatile, fast, clean, doesn’t emit fumes or vapors, and doesn’t require chemicals.</p>

<p>In the last review, Neil said he wanted to see designs <em>from the final project</em>.<br />
→ not what you feel like<br />
→ not something random<br />
→ from the final project</p>
<p>Following that philosophy, I’m going to cut the logos of my projects. There are two reasons why all my projects have a name/brand.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The first reason is that I intend to commercialize them. In a few weeks, there’s a class called <em>Invention, Intellectual Property, and Income</em>. Over many years following the Fab Academy, I hear people who completely ignore that week saying they “have no commercial interest”, they do it “for the love of art”, “for the good of humanity”. How nice. Dear friends: As far as I’m aware, you can’t pay your taxes with your final project, nor with courses to your community, nor with aquaponics lettuces. They only accept money.</li>
<li>The second reason why I put a short name is because cutting is easy, the machine does it. But weeding the figure from the background with tweezers is torture, especially if the sticker is this:</li>

<h1 id="characterize-the-laser-cutter">Characterize… the laser cutter?</h1>
<p><span class="smallcaps">I’d love to get my hands on Neil’s laser cutter</span>. <strong>My laser cutter doesn’t stick to a fixed kerf</strong>. The <em>power</em> and <em>cutting speed</em> influence the kerf, the <em>material</em> impacts the kerf, the <em>thickness</em> of the material plays a role in the kerf, even the <em>color</em><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Dark colors absorb more radiation and are easier to cut<br />
<br />
</span></span> of the material messes with the kerf. I have to follow a process to characterize each material with the laser. Even though I usually don’t showcase it in the documentation, I go through this process every time I tweak any material parameter. It’s a hassle, I know. But skipping these minutes can cost you hours of setbacks and frustration later on or even ruin all your hard work. Here’s my free advice of the week:</p>
<center>
<em>spend those minutes wisely</em>
</center>
<p>The first thing I do is hunt down the optimal cutting or marking parameters. I grab a sample<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">5x5 cm is sufficient<br />
<br />
</span></span> of the material I want to characterize. Pop it on the platform and make sure the focus is spot-on. The goal is to find <em>the lowest possible energy<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">It’s a combo of power, speed, number of passes, and frequency, if it has one. My laser (Full Spectrum 5th gen) doesn’t have frequency control. Whenever possible, I aim for maximum speed. If it’s a heat-sensitive material (like corrugated polypropylene), I make multiple passes at low power.<br />
<br />
</span></span></em> that cuts the material without warping or toasting it. I create a pattern in Inkscape with copies in different colors and assign a setting to each line. As a starting point, you can use settings for a material and a machine similar to yours. Some machines come with a library of materials and default cutting settings. I usually kick off at +5% from the known setting and drop 5% on each line. The key is to jot down those settings on the same material and save them for future reference. These settings come in handy every time I want to cut or mark the material.</p>

<p>Only then do I move on to measure the kerf. But remember, if you change any parameter, that kerf is no longer valid.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">The vinyl cutter is my preferred machine</span>. It’s versatile, fast, clean, emits no smoke or vapors, and requires no chemicals.</p>

<p>In the latest review, Neil mentioned wanting to see designs <em>for the final project</em>.<br />
→ not whatever you feel like<br />
→ not something random<br />
→ for the final project</p>
<p>Following that philosophy, I’m going to cut the logos of my projects. There are two reasons why all my projects have a name/brand.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The first reason is that I intend to commercialize them. In a few weeks, there’s a class called <em>Invention, Intellectual Property, and Income</em>. Throughout many years following Fab Academy, I hear people completely ignoring that week, saying they “aren’t motivated by commercial interest,” they do it “for the love of art,” “for the good of humanity.” How lovely. Dear friends: As far as I know, you can’t pay taxes with your final project, nor with courses for your community, nor with aquaponics lettuces. They only accept money.</li>
<li>The second reason I give a short name is that cutting is easy; the machine does it. But weeding the figure from the background with tweezers is torture, especially if the sticker is this:</li>

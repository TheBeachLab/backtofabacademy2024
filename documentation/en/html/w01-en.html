<h2 id="reinventing-my-documentation-process">Reinventing My
Documentation Process</h2>
<p>I have to be realistic. I don‚Äôt have much free time, and soon I‚Äôll
have even less. So, I need a system to quickly write documentation. I‚Äôm
going to try out a new system for documenting. As an unexpected benefit,
this system will allow me to have the documentation in two (or more)
languages.</p>
<h3 id="using-markdown">Using Markdown</h3>
<p>Here, I don‚Äôt want to be too innovative. The strategy that has worked
very well for me for many years is to write content in a plain text file
in a format called <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org">Markdown</a>
<code>.md</code>. This way, I focus only on writing the content.
Advantages of writing in Markdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>You don‚Äôt need any special program to write plain text. You could
even write it by hand if your handwriting is good and then scan it.</li>
<li>It‚Äôs easy to write; you don‚Äôt have to contort your fingers typing
<code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code> and stuff like that.</li>
<li>It‚Äôs easy to apply styles and organize the text.</li>
<li>It can be read without feeling like you‚Äôre decoding The Matrix.</li>
</ul>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">When you can read your page from HTML
code</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The documentation for Fab Academy has to be presented in the form of
a web page. There‚Äôs a command-line program called <a
href="https://pandoc.org/index.html">Pandoc</a> that literally converts
any text format. I‚Äôm going to use it to convert <code>.md</code> files
into ‚Äúnicely looking‚Äù <code>.html</code> pages with a CSS style
template.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: ‚ÄúNice‚Äù refers to easy to read. Other people value above all the
visual appearance of the page and prefer to spend time creating their
own masterpiece. My best wishes to them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Temporarily, I‚Äôm using the <a
href="http://htgaa.beachlab.org">template I used for HTGAA</a> in 2015.
But I plan to switch to <a
href="https://jez.io/pandoc-markdown-css-theme/">this template soon</a>,
because I need to add more functionalities (equations, tables, line
numbers in code, side notes, etc.).</p>
<h3 id="saving-time-by-dictating">Saving Time by Dictating</h3>
<p>Most of the text you‚Äôre reading has been dictated <strong>in
Spanish</strong> into a Markdown text file. The reason I don‚Äôt directly
dictate it in English is because my accent is so bad that the computer
fails to understand me. For dictation, I‚Äôm using macOS‚Äôs dictation
tool.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/w01/dictation.webp" /></p>
<p>I really like this tool because: - It works everywhere on the
operating system, including the terminal. - It allows you to speak and
pause for up to 30 seconds without disconnecting. - You can edit the
text while dictating. - You can add emojis üòä - It adds punctuation
automatically, and you can also do it manually. - You can also change
lines and paragraphs by saying so. - If your processor is Apple Silicon,
it understands context and autocorrects. All of this offline. - I can
use it while listening to music with my headphones.</p>
<p>Here is the complete list of commands in <a
href="https://support.apple.com/es-es/guide/mac-help/mh40695/14.0/mac/14.0">Spanish</a>,
<a
href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh40695/14.0/mac/14.0">English</a>,
and <a
href="https://support.apple.com/de-de/guide/mac-help/mh40695/14.0/mac/14.0">German</a>.
This saves me some time when writing. I have to type some parts
manually, for instance, when writing code or including links. I also
have to make some manual corrections.</p>
<h3 id="file-structure">File Structure</h3>
<p>In this way, I am generating Markdown files with documentation in
Spanish. At first, I wrote the text for each week in a single file. But
as you‚Äôll read later on, I use a paid service for translation. Every
time I edited a line, I had to translate the whole file again. To cut
down on costs, I now divide the week into chapters and create a file for
each chapter. This way, only the chapters I‚Äôve modified get translated.
My file structure is inspired by the programming language <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a>:</p>
<pre><code>/documentation
    /es
        /md
            /w01
                w01-chapter-00-es.md
                w01-chapter-10-es.md
                w01-chapter-20-es.md
                w01-chapter-21-es.md
                ...
                w01-chapter-90-es.md
                w01-chapter-99-es.md</code></pre>
<p>The name of each week‚Äôs file encodes the week number, chapter, and
language of the documentation. Chapter 00 is the header. I use chapters
10, 20, 30‚Ä¶ to develop the sections of the week. If a chapter is too
long, I subdivide it using the intermediate numbers: 20, 21, 22, etc.
Chapter 90 is always the conclusion, and 99 is the footer.</p>
<p>Later, I concatenate all the chapters of the week into a single file,
in this case: <code>w01-es.md</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> I never manually edit the
concatenated file. I only edit the separate chapters.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="ai-powered-automatic-translations">AI-Powered Automatic
Translations</h3>
<p>At Fab Academy, all documentation must be in English. Traditional
language translators often fall short. They fail to understand context
and produce results that don‚Äôt sound natural. I plan to use artificial
intelligence to translate the text of the chapters into English and also
into German.</p>
<p>The AI model needs to be capable of recognizing Markdown syntax and
respecting it. It will also need to handle internal links, because the
links that go from <code>w02-es.md</code> in the Spanish documentation
need to be changed to <code>w02-en.md</code> in the English version of
the documentation. It‚Äôs possible that the model might improve (or even
change) throughout fab academy. Therefore, I‚Äôll keep the text in Spanish
and rerun the translation of all the files from time to time. I will
only edit the files in Spanish. I won‚Äôt manually manipulate the
generated translations. So, if what you read in English or German
doesn‚Äôt make sense, blame OpenAI or whatever model I‚Äôm using.</p>
<p>I asked C√©sar Garcia, from <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/lahoramaker">La Hora Maker</a>, to help me
find a model for the translation. C√©sar recommended using OpenAI‚Äôs
Whisper API, which is capable of translating directly from Spanish
audio. For now, I‚Äôm only interested in translation, so I‚Äôve created an
assistant in the OpenAI API with the following instructions:</p>
<pre><code>Translate the text from Spanish to English, Read the entire document to grasp context before translating it, take into account nuances and idioms of the Spanish language and translate them to the equivalents in English. The translation should not be literal, focus on maintaining the original meaning and provide a translation that makes sense in english. Ignore external URLs and code snippets in the translation; if encountering a markdown link, translate the text inside square brackets. Modify internal markdown link URLs to point to the appropriate english file, e.g., change w01-es.md to w01-en.md. Recognize and retain brands and names without translation. Use correct grammar and syntax in the final text. The style of the translation should be informal.</code></pre>
<p>I have another model in German with similar instructions. I‚Äôve been
changing the instructions from time to time to try to improve the
translation.</p>
<p>The page you‚Äôre reading is about 4000 tokens. You can find out how
many tokens a text has using the <a
href="https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer">OpenAI Tokenizer</a>. The
cost of translating this page into the two languages is roughly 0.32
USD, considering that each 1000 tokens cost 0.01 USD for the input and
0.03 USD for the output. I find it quite expensive, and moreover, the
cost is going to rise as Fab Academy progresses. For this reason, I will
only translate the contents when I consider the work to be advanced.</p>
<p>So far, the translations are quite good. Sometimes it doesn‚Äôt change
the links correctly, so in the future, I will perform that task through
a script which is more reliable. I asked <a
href="https://fabacademy.org/2024/labs/kamplintfort/students/sophia-doring/">Sophia
D√∂ring</a> to also review the German translation. She told me that
overall it is quite good, although sometimes it uses German words that
are rarely used, especially for technical terms. That might be caused by
how I write the original text. I‚Äôm using Spanish equivalents for
technical terms that I actually say in English in everyday life.</p>
<p>On my wish list, I‚Äôll keep looking for a local model. That way, I can
translate content more frequently. For now, I‚Äôve been testing the
<code>Phi 2</code> and <code>Yarn Mistral</code> models with disastrous
results.</p>
<h3 id="automating-the-translation-process">Automating the Translation
Process</h3>
<p>At first, I was using the OpenAI API console. Now, I have automated
this process using Python on the command line. By mixing Bing Copilot
and the free version of ChatGPT, I requested a program that would
automate translation using the OpenAI library. However, it didn‚Äôt go
well. After quite a bit of back-and-forth (AI usually doesn‚Äôt generate
correct code on the first try), I ended up frustrated and cursing at
Bing.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/w01/bing.webp" /></p>
<p>Eventually, I had to read the API documentation to get the program
working.</p>
<p>To avoid unnecessary extra costs, the script only translates the
Spanish chapters that I have added using <code>git add</code>. Thanks to
this, I can better control the cost. Once that‚Äôs done, I simply execute
<code>python translate-en.py</code>, and the script generates the
Markdown pages translated into English. I do the same for German.</p>
<p>In reality, I usually don‚Äôt do the translation in isolation because
I‚Äôve incorporated it into the next step.</p>
<h3 id="automating-the-entire-process">Automating the Entire
Process</h3>
<p>To automate the entire process, I converted a Bash script I made for
the educational program <a
href="https://github.com/Academany/fabzero">FabZero</a> into Python. I
write something like this:</p>
<p><code>python auto.py --translate updating week 1</code></p>
<p>The script translates the updated chapters if it finds
<code>--translate</code> among the arguments. I do this to save costs.
Then, it concatenates all chapters and creates a single Markdown file
for each week. The next step is converting all these files into HTML.
During the conversion, if it finds a link to a markdown document, it
converts it into a link to its corresponding HTML document using <a
href="../../../links-to-html.lua">this LUA filter</a>. Finally, it
uploads everything to Github as long as there is a message, which in
this case is <code>updating week 1</code>. If there‚Äôs no message, it
doesn‚Äôt carry out any of the processes related to git.</p>
<p>You can check out the script here: <a
href="../../../auto.py">auto.py</a></p>
<h3 id="using-cdci-on-github-to-serve-web-pages">Using CD/CI on Github
to Serve Web Pages</h3>
<p>Let‚Äôs check out what I‚Äôve got on Github so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>My original <code>.md</code> files in Spanish</li>
<li>The <code>.md</code> files translated to English and German by
AI</li>
<li>The <code>.html</code> pages generated by Pandoc from all
<code>.md</code> files.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only thing missing now is a web server. And you can set that up
on Github by going to the repository settings.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/w01/cicd.webp" /></p>
<p>This will create a file named
<code>.github/workflows/static.yml</code>. I only had to modify the
<code>runner</code> because <code>runs-on: ubuntu-latest</code> wasn‚Äôt
working. I switched it to <code>runs-on: ubuntu-22.04</code> and upon
committing, the pages were automatically served.</p>

<h2 id="git-that-never-ending-well">Git: That Never-Ending Well</h2>
<p>One might think that since I‚Äôve been using git for 10 years, I
already know everything there is to know about the version control
system. Not at all. These are the things I want to improve during this
Fab Academy cycle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suppress my tendency to push changes to the main branch. Usually,
nothing goes wrong, but I need to get used to creating a new branch for
each change.</li>
<li><del>Steal</del> Get inspired by <a
href="http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/project_management/archive.html">Neil‚Äôs
aliases</a> to execute git commands more quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p>(I might add more things throughout Fab Academy‚Ä¶)</p>
<h2 id="project-management">Project Management</h2>
<p>I‚Äôd like to explain how I manage my projects. When you have no boss,
and no one tells you what to do, you need to be very disciplined.
Otherwise, you might fall into a negative spiral.</p>
<p>The most important thing is <strong>knowing where you‚Äôre
headed</strong>. Because if you don‚Äôt, you have a very serious problem.
Sometimes you‚Äôll find yourself lost in the Fab Academy (and in your
life). You won‚Äôt know what you want to do, you won‚Äôt feel like doing
anything, and it seems like you‚Äôre moving in slow motion while the world
speeds past you. When that happens, remember <a
href="https://www.thetoolsbook.com">Phil Stutz</a>. Invest in yourself:
Exercise, reconnect with other people, write your memories in a journal.
It helps me, and I‚Äôm convinced it will help you too. Soon, you‚Äôll see
your North Star. Head towards it.</p>
<p>The second thing is <strong>learning to reduce and simplify</strong>.
One of your biggest problems in Fab Academy will be similar to this: You
can‚Äôt find a photo you‚Äôre sure you had. You don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs in your
phone‚Äôs photos, on Google Drive, or on a USB drive, if you moved it to a
folder on your computer, or if someone sent it to you on WhatsApp‚Ä¶
Simplify. Reduce.</p>
<p>And lastly, and I believe most importantly, the real secret to
achieving anything, no matter how difficult it is, is to make
<strong>many small steps</strong>. Solve a small problem, then another,
and then another one. That‚Äôs how it works.</p>
<p>In terms of tools to help you manage, I‚Äôve tried a few. So I‚Äôll start
with the ones that don‚Äôt work for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Post-it notes on the wall. The idea is good. Very visual and agile.
But it has two problems. First problem: In Barcelona, it‚Äôs often very
hot, and the notes fall off. Second problem: If I can‚Äôt see the wall,
there‚Äôs no project.</li>
<li>Kanban-style software and similar. They try to mimic Post-it notes.
I don‚Äôt use them because: They seem complicated and don‚Äôt let me
draw.</li>
<li>Microsoft Project and similar. No comment.</li>
<li>Web services like Notion.com, Monday.com, and similar. I refuse to
spend a single second of my short life trying to understand how a
service that only looks easy on TikTok and will probably shut down
tomorrow afternoon works.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, I‚Äôm using a combination of plain text for long-term goals,
reminders for medium-term goals, and Apple‚Äôs Freeform for tasks I‚Äôm
going to do today. Freeform is an app with an infinite canvas, similar
to <a href="https://miro.com">Miro</a>. It has the advantages of Post-it
notes without their disadvantages. I can customize it and create my own
system. For example, I‚Äôve created the <code>DOING NOW</code> box where
only one note fits. This is important to me because I can only do one
thing at a time. I can also draw by hand, and I like that. I‚Äôll probably
make a video explaining everything in more detail.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/w01/freeform.webp" /></p>
<h2 id="final-project-sketch">Final Project Sketch</h2>
<p>Everything related to the final project has been moved to its <a
href="final-en.html">designated section</a>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>All of this is making the documentation writing process slow and
somewhat tedious at the moment. However, I believe that with this
system, <strong>the pace is going to pick up dramatically week by
week</strong>, and eventually, I will be able to document things quickly
and with a great level of detail.</p>
<p>Moreover, I think this method will <strong>assist</strong> many
people who can‚Äôt <strong>express their talent</strong> because they
don‚Äôt master another language. It‚Äôs unfair for that to happen. I hope AI
helps people demonstrate how valuable they are.</p>

<p>Let me figure out how to explain this… Better yet, I’ll explain it in a video<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Coming soon on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKDpiLmgp6Evt30dhHgRlcB80OhMfcs2W">Youtube</a> or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thebeachlab">Instagram</a>.<br />

<h3 id="my-keyboard-is-weird">My keyboard is weird</h3>
<p><span class="smallcaps">While working on organizing Fab15 in Egypt</span>, I noticed Sherry Lassiter typing at lightning speed without looking at the keyboard. At that time, I typed with two fingers and always looked at the keyboard. So, I decided to learn. There’s an advantage when you learn something from scratch – you have no bad habits. So, I didn’t learn the QWERTY system, which was originally designed to prevent old typewriters from jamming. I learned with the <a href="https://colemak.com">Colemak</a><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Colemak is designed so that the most frequently used letters in the English language are on the middle row.<br />
<br />
</span></span> system. I have an <a href="https://drop.com/buy/preonic-mechanical-keyboard">ortho-linear keyboard</a> with a Colemak layout, and I practice for about five minutes a day.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../../img/w01/preonic.webp" alt="What I like the most about the Colemak layout is that the delete key is to the left of the A key" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">What I like the most about the Colemak layout is that the delete key is to the left of the <code>A</code> key</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I also have a <a href="https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org">software on macOS</a> that switches my keyboard layout to Colemak and also changes the function of the caps lock key<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">In reality, I only used it to insult<br />
<br />
</span></span> to backspace.</p>
<h3 id="my-text-editor-is-also-weird">My text editor is also weird</h3>
<p><span class="smallcaps">My intention is to use only <code>vim</code></span>, a command-line text editor. I have some knowledge of <code>vim</code> and I want to dive deeper into learning it. I like the idea of using only the keyboard to edit text. To avoid the temptation of using Visual Studio Code, I have uninstalled it<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Just kidding, I only removed the shortcut.<br />
<br />
</span></span>. The vim text editor is quite sparse by default. That’s why I have installed some plugins. Here is a list that I will expand over time:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree">→ NERDTree</a> to have a sidebar with a file listing, so you can navigate quickly between files.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ryanoasis/vim-devicons">→ vim-devicons</a> to visualize files and folders with a small graphic icon.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2 id="reinventing-the-wheel">Reinventing the Wheel</h2>
<p><span class="smallcaps">I don’t have much free time</span>. So, I need to come up with a system to write documentation quickly. As an unexpected benefit, this system allows you to have the documentation in two (or more) languages.</p>
<h3 id="using-markdown">Using Markdown</h3>
<p>“I’m not exactly looking to break new ground here”. The strategy that has served me well for many years is to write content in a plain text file in a format called Markdown <code>.md</code>. This way, I focus solely on writing the content. Advantages of writing in Markdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>You don’t need any special program to write plain text. You could even write it by hand if you have nice handwriting and scan it later.</li>
<li>It’s easy to write, you don’t have to twist your fingers typing <code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code> and stuff like that.</li>
<li>It’s easy to apply styles and organize text.</li>
<li>It can be read without feeling like you’re decoding The Matrix.</li>
</ul>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">When you can read your page from the HTML code</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Fab Academy documentation must be presented in the form of a web page. There is a command-line program called <a href="https://pandoc.org/index.html">Pandoc</a> that literally converts any text format. I’m going to use it to convert <code>.md</code> files into <em>nice-looking</em><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-5" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><em>Nice-looking</em> refers to being easy to read. Other people value the visual aspect of the page above all and prefer to spend time creating their own masterpiece. My best wishes to them.<br />
<br />
</span></span> <code>.html</code> pages with a CSS style template. The template has two advantages. On one hand, it allows me to forget about the visual aspect of the page. On the other hand, it makes it easy to add functionalities such as equations, tables, line numbers in the code, side notes, etc.</p>
<p>The template I’ve used is called <a href="https://github.com/jez/tufte-pandoc-css">Tufte CSS.</a><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-6" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Strongly inspired by the visual style of Edward R. Tufte’s books.<br />
<br />
</span></span> I modified the template because it wasn’t fully designed for multiple languages.</p>

<h3 id="saving-time-by-dictating">Saving time by dictating</h3>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Most of the text you’re reading</span>, is being dictated <strong>in Spanish</strong><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-7" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">The reason why I don’t dictate directly in English is that my accent is so bad that the computer can’t understand me.<br />
<br />
</span></span> inside a Markdown file. For dictating, I’m using macOS’s dictation tool.</p>
<p>I really like this tool because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It works everywhere in the operating system, including the terminal.</li>
<li>It allows you to speak and take breaks of up to 30 seconds without disconnecting.</li>
<li>You can edit the text while you are dictating.</li>
<li>You can add emojis 😊</li>
<li>It adds punctuation marks automatically, and you can also add them manually.</li>
<li>You can also change lines and paragraphs using your voice.</li>
<li>If your processor is Apple Silicon, it understands context and autocorrects. All this without a connection.</li>
<li>I can use it while listening to music with my headphones.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the complete list of voice commands in <a href="https://support.apple.com/es-es/guide/mac-help/mh40695/14.0/mac/14.0">Spanish</a>, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh40695/14.0/mac/14.0">English</a>, and <a href="https://support.apple.com/de-de/guide/mac-help/mh40695/14.0/mac/14.0">German</a>. This saves me some time when writing. Some parts I have to write manually, for example, when I write code or include links. I also have to make some manual corrections.</p>
<h3 id="file-structure">File Structure</h3>
<p>In the beginning, I used to write the text for each week in a single file. But as you’ll read later, I use a paid service for translation. Every time I edited a line, I had to translate the entire file again. To cut costs, I’ve divided the week into chapters<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-8" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-8" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">My file structure is inspired by the programming language <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a><br />
<br />
</span></span> and created a file for each chapter. That way, only the chapters I’ve modified get translated.</p>
<pre><code>/documentation
    /es
        /md
            /w01
                w01-chapter-00.md
                w01-chapter-10.md
                w01-chapter-20.md
                w01-chapter-21.md
                ...
                w01-chapter-90.md</code></pre>
<p>The file name encodes the week I’m in and the chapter. Chapter 00 is the header. I use chapters 10, 20, 30… to develop the sections of the week. If a chapter gets too long, I subdivide it using intermediate numbers: 20, 21, 22, etc. Chapter 90 is always the conclusion.</p>
<p>Later, I concatenate<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-9" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-9" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><strong>Important Note:</strong> I never manually edit the concatenated file. I only edit the separate chapters.<br />
<br />
</span></span> all the chapters of the week into a single file, in this case, <code>w01.md</code>.</p>
<h3 id="ai-driven-automatic-translations">AI-driven automatic translations</h3>
<p>At Fab Academy, documentation has to be in English. Traditional language translators are pretty bad. They can’t understand context and produce results that don’t sound natural. I’ll be using artificial intelligence to translate the text of the chapters into English and also into German.</p>
<p>The AI model must be able to recognize Markdown syntax and respect it. The model may improve (or even change) throughout Fab Academy. That’s why I’ll keep the text in Spanish and rerun the translations on all files from time to time. I will only edit the files in Spanish. I won’t manually manipulate the generated translations. So, if what you read in English or German makes no sense, blame OpenAI or whichever model I’m using.</p>
<p>I asked César Garcia, from La Hora Maker, to help me find a model for translation. César recommended using OpenAI’s Whisper API, which can translate directly from Spanish audio. For now, I’m only interested in the translation, so I created an assistant in the OpenAI API with these instructions:</p>
<pre><code>Translate the text from Spanish to English. Read the entire document to grasp the context before translating it. Take into account nuances and idioms of the Spanish language and translate them into their English equivalents. The translation should not be literal, focusing on maintaining the original meaning and providing a translation that makes sense in English. Only translate the text within quotes in the YAML header of the Markdown file. Do not translate links, URLs, blocks of code, and code snippets. If encountering a markdown link, only translate the text inside square brackets. Recognize and retain brands and names without translation. Use correct grammar and syntax in the final text. The style of the translation should be informal, with a touch of sarcastic humor.</code></pre>
<p>I have another model in German with similar instructions. I keep changing the instructions from time to time to try and improve the translation.</p>
<p>This page you’re reading has about 4000 tokens. You can find out how many tokens a text has using the OpenAI Tokenizer. The cost of translating this page into the two languages is approximately 0.32 USD, considering that every 1000 tokens cost 0.01 USD for the input and 0.03 USD for the output. It seems pretty expensive to me, and the cost will go up as Fab Academy progresses. For that reason, I will only translate contents when I consider the work advanced.</p>
<p>For the moment, the English translations are quite good. I asked <a href="">Sophia Döring</a> to also review the German translation. She said that, in general, it’s also quite good, although sometimes it uses German words that are infrequently used, especially for referring to technical terms.</p>
<p>In my wish list, I will continue looking for a local model. That way, I can translate the content more frequently and without worrying about the cost. I recently tried the <code>Miqu-1-70b</code><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-10" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-10" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Note<br />
<br />
</span></span> model with slow but satisfactory results. I see light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<h3 id="automating-the-translation">Automating the Translation</h3>
<p>Initially, I was using the OpenAI API window. Now, I’ve automated this process with a Python script. Using a mix of Bing Copilot and the free version of ChatGPT, I asked for a program that would automate the translation using the OpenAI library. But it didn’t go well. After a lot of back-and-forth (AI doesn’t usually generate correct code on the first try), I ended up frustrated and cursing at Bing.</p>
<p>In the end, I had to read the API documentation to make the program work.</p>
<p>To avoid unnecessary extra costs, the script only translates Spanish chapters that I’ve added using <code>git add</code>. Thanks to this, I can better control the cost. Once done, I simply run <code>python translate-en.py</code> and the script generates the Markdown pages translated to English. I do the same for German.</p>
<p>Actually, I usually don’t do the translation in isolation, because I’ve included it in the next step.</p>
<h3 id="all-in-one">All in one</h3>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Here’s how my process works:</span> When I’m done editing the chapters, I run the following script<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-11" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-11" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">It’s a script originally written in Bash language that I created for the educational program <a href="https://github.com/Academany/fabzero">FabZero</a> and now I have converted to Python.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><code>python auto.py --translate updating week 1</code></p>
<p>If the script finds <code>--translate</code> among the arguments<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-12" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-12" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">I do this to save costs, as I don’t want to translate the pages every time they are modified.<br />
<br />
</span></span>, it translates the modified chapters. Then it concatenates all the chapters and creates a single Markdown file for each week. The next step is to convert all those files into HTML. If, during the conversion, it finds a link to a Markdown document, it converts it into a link to its corresponding HTML document using <a href="../../../links-to-html.lua">this LUA filter</a>. Finally, it uploads everything to Github provided there is a message, which in this case is <code>updating week 1</code>. If there is no message, it doesn’t perform any of the processes related to git.</p>
<p>You can analyze the script here: <a href="../../../auto.py">auto.py</a></p>
<h3 id="serving-web-pages">Serving Web Pages</h3>
<p>Let’s take a look at what I have on GitHub so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>My original <code>.md</code> files in Spanish</li>
<li>The <code>.md</code> files translated into English and German by AI</li>
<li>The <code>.html</code> pages generated by Pandoc for all <code>.md</code> files.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only thing missing now is a web server. And you can set that up from GitHub by going to the repository’s CI/CD settings.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/w01/cicd.webp" /></p>
<p>This will create a file in <code>.github/workflows/static.yml</code>, of which I only had to change the <code>runner</code>, because <code>runs-on: ubuntu-latest</code> wasn’t working. I changed it to <code>runs-on: ubuntu-22.04</code> and upon committing, the pages were automatically served.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">I’d like to dedicate a few lines</span> to explain how I manage my projects<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-13" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-13" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Don’t let anyone tell you how to manage a project. It’s something very personal and you have to create your own system.<br />
<br />
</span></span>. When you don’t have a boss, and nobody tells you what to do, you have to be very disciplined. Otherwise, you might fall into a negative spiral.</p>
<p>The most important thing is <strong>knowing where you’re going</strong>. Because if you don’t, you’ve got a serious problem. Sometimes you’ll find yourself lost in Fab Academy (and in your life). You don’t know what you want to do, you don’t feel like doing anything, and it seems like you’re moving in slow motion while the world races by. When that happens, remember <a href="https://www.thetoolsbook.com">Phil Stutz</a>. Invest in yourself: Exercise, connect with others, write in a journal. It helps me and I’m convinced it will help you too. Soon, you’ll see your North Star. Head towards it.</p>
<p>Second is <strong>learning to reduce and simplify</strong>. One of your biggest problems in Fab Academy will be something like this: You can’t find a photo that you’re sure you had. You don’t know if it’s in your phone’s photos, on Google Drive, or on a USB drive, if you moved it to your computer’s folder, or if someone gave it to you on WhatsApp… Simplify. Reduce.</p>
<p>And lastly, and I think most importantly, the real secret to achieving anything, no matter how difficult, is by taking <strong>many, very small steps</strong>. You solve a small problem, then another, and then another. That’s how it works.</p>
<p>As for tools to help you manage, I’ve tried a few. So I’ll start with the ones that don’t work for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Post-it notes on the wall. The idea is good. Very visual and quick. But it has two problems. First problem: In Barcelona, it’s usually very hot and the notes fall off. Second problem: If I can’t see the wall, there’s no project.</li>
<li>Kanban-like software and similar. They try to mimic Post-it notes. I don’t use them because: I find them complicated and they don’t let me draw.</li>
<li>Microsoft Project and the like. No comment.</li>
<li>Web services like Notion.com, Monday.com, and similar. I’m not going to spend a second of my short life trying to understand how a service that only seems easy on TikTok (and will probably shut down tomorrow afternoon) works.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, I’m using a combination of plain text for long-term goals, reminders for medium-term goals, and Apple’s Freeform for the tasks I’m going to do today. Freeform is a program with an infinite canvas, similar to <a href="https://miro.com">Miro</a>. It has the advantages of Post-it notes without their drawbacks. I can customize it and create my own system. For example, I’ve created the <code>DOING NOW</code> box where only one note fits. For me, that’s important because I can only do one thing at a time. I can also draw by hand, and I like that. I’ll probably make a video explaining everything in more detail.</p>

<h2 id="final-project-sketch">Final Project Sketch</h2>
<p>Everything related to the final project has been shuffled off to its <a href="final.html">designated section</a>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p><span class="smallcaps">At this moment</span>, this entire system is making writing documentation slow and slightly tedious. But I believe that with this system, <strong>speed will dramatically increase week by week</strong> and eventually, I’ll be able to document things quickly and with great detail.</p>
<p>Moreover, I think this method is going to <strong>help</strong> many people who can’t <strong>express their talent</strong> because they’re not fluent in another language. It’s unfair for that to happen. I hope AI helps people demonstrate how valuable they are.</p>

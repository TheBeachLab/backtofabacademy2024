## ~~Ikigai~~ Venn Diagram

<figure>
^[{-} The 6 projects drawn over my "Venn diagram". This is not ikigai (生き甲斐). The Mirai project is too personal, I don't think it has a market outlet. Only Nest is a project that clearly benefits society.]

## The Verdict
I'm supposed to decide on one now. But I won’t. Instead, I'll move forward with all the project I have underway. To manage them simultaneously, I will move in small spirals. Some will fall by the wayside, and only one will consolidate as the final project.

Each project is hosted in its own repository. This page will follow the progress of each of them like a journal.

# The ideas
Why even think about starting a new project when I've already got several half-done ones? Allow me to introduce the candidates... (it’s better if you read this with epic background music →)[^100]

## Alphabets 
[^101] Alphabets is a modular mechanical screen designed for displaying interactive messages. It's a project I started in 2014 and have abandoned and picked up again on multiple occasions. It’s commercially a great product. It was so successful that some people even asked me to send them between 800 and 1000 units.

## Night
[comment1]: <> (Note for the translator: 'Night' is a proper name, do not translate it)
[^102] *Day & Night* are the names of two[^103] automated Newtonian Dobsonian reflecting telescopes for tracking celestial bodies, capturing, and stacking images. They are identical except one is white and the other is black. Light and darkness, day and night.

    Why two? Yet another unkept promise I made.

## Solo
[comment2]: <> (Note for the translator: 'Solo' is a proper name, do not translate it)
[^104] *Solo* is the name of an accessory for SLR cameras that facilitates personal video recording by automatic focusing and some camera movements. The only thing standing between success and me is my laziness.

## Mirai 未来
[^105] Mirai is a portable microcomputer with a *retro cyberdeck* aesthetic that incorporates a mechanical keyboard. It aims to revive the nostalgia for analog devices and the design of the 80s through digital manufacturing. The idea of a modular computer has always been appealing to me. Why do we have to replace the entire computer when we only want a new processor or more memory?

## Scylla Σκύλλα
 [^106] Scylla *is*[^107] a turbine-powered hydrofoil designed for recreational activities in seas or lakes. After disastrous week 2, this project has a serious prognosis with a negative outlook.

[^107]: Scylla *was* a creature from Greek mythology that tormented ships in the Strait of Messina.

## Nest 
 [^108] Nest is not a dwelling, but you can live in it. It’s a portable life support module for temporary use, targeted at the single-person market[^109]. I worked on this project theoretically during my time at the MIT Entrepreneurship Bootcamp and it received a very positive response. I’d like to pick it up again and make a prototype, even if it's not fully functional (I think it's a project to tackle as a group).

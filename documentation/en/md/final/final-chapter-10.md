## Alphabets
Alphabets is a modular mechanical display for showcasing interactive messages. It's a project I started in 2014 and have abandoned and picked up multiple times.

## *Night*
*Day & Night* are the names of two[^101] automated Dobson Newtonian reflecting telescopes for tracking celestial bodies, capturing, and stacking images. They are identical, except one is white and the other black. Light and darkness, day and night.

[^101]: Why two? Just another in a long list of promises I've broken.

## *Solo*
*Solo* is the name of an accessory for SLR cameras that facilitates personal video recording by automating focusing and some camera movements.

## Mirai 未来
Mirai is a portable microcomputer with a *retro cyberdeck* aesthetic that incorporates a mechanical keyboard. It aims to revive the nostalgia for analog devices and the design of the 80s through digital manufacturing.

[^102]: Scylla *was* a creature from Greek mythology that tormented ships in the Strait of Messina.

## Nest
Nest is not a dwelling, but you can live in it. It's a life support module for temporary use, portable and aimed at the single-person market. Occasionally two ;-)

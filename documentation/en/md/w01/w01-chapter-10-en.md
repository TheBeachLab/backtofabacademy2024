## My Environment

### I'm using macOS again. How could I have sunk so low?
Let's see how I explain this... I'll explain another day.

### My keyboard is weird
I never knew how to type, although I always wanted to learn. While working at the organization of Fab15 in Egypt, I noticed that Sherry Lassiter has a great ability to type. At that moment, I decided to learn. There's an advantage when you learn something from scratch, and it's that you don't have any bad habits. So, I didn't learn the QWERTY system, which was originally designed to prevent the old typewriters from jamming. I learned with the [Colemak](https://colemak.com) system instead. Colemak is designed so that the most frequently used letters in the English language are on the middle row. I have an [ortho-linear keyboard](https://drop.com/buy/preonic-mechanical-keyboard) that I've set up with the Colemak layout, and I practice about five minutes a day. What I like most about the Colemak layout is that the backspace key is next to the `A` key.

I also have [software on macOS](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org) that changes my keyboard layout to Colemak and also changes the function of the caps lock key to backspace.

### My text editor is also weird
My intention is to use only `vim`, a command-line text editor. I have some knowledge of `vim` and want to deepen my learning. I like the idea of using only the keyboard to edit text. To avoid the temptation of using Visual Studio Code, I have uninstalled it. The vim text editor is quite sparse by default. Therefore, I'm going to install some plugins. Here is a list that I will expand over time:

- [NERDTree](https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree) to have a sidebar with the list of files, so I can quickly navigate between them.
- [vim-devicons](https://github.com/ryanoasis/vim-devicons) to display a small graphic icon for files and folders.

Other useful links:

- [VimAwesome](https://vimawesome.com) is a page with hundreds of vim plugins
- [Fran's My Computing repo](https://github.com/TheBeachLab/myComputing) with some tricks, if you like using the command line.

## Saving time by dictating
[Most of the text you're reading]{.smallcaps}, is being dictated **in Spanish**[^221] inside a Markdown file. For dictating, I'm using macOS's dictation tool.

[^221]: The reason why I don't dictate directly in English is that my accent is so bad that the computer can't understand me.

I really like this tool because:

- It works everywhere in the operating system, including the terminal.
- It allows you to speak and take breaks of up to 30 seconds without disconnecting.
- You can edit the text while you are dictating.
- You can add emojis ðŸ˜Š
- It adds punctuation marks automatically, and you can also add them manually.
- You can also change lines and paragraphs using your voice.
- If your processor is Apple Silicon, it understands context and autocorrects. All this without a connection.
- I can use it while listening to music with my headphones.

Here is the complete list of voice commands in [Spanish](https://support.apple.com/es-es/guide/mac-help/mh40695/14.0/mac/14.0), [English](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh40695/14.0/mac/14.0), and [German](https://support.apple.com/de-de/guide/mac-help/mh40695/14.0/mac/14.0). This saves me some time when writing. Some parts I have to write manually, for example, when I write code or include links. I also have to make some manual corrections.

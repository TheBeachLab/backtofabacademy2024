## Git: That Never-Ending Well

One might think that since I've been using git for 10 years, I already know everything there is to know about the version control system. Not at all. These are the things I want to improve during this Fab Academy cycle:

- Suppress my tendency to push changes to the main branch. Usually, nothing goes wrong, but I need to get used to creating a new branch for each change.
- ~~Steal~~ Get inspired by [Neil's aliases](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/project_management/archive.html) to execute git commands more quickly.

(I might add more things throughout Fab Academy...)

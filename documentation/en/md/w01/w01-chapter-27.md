## Serving Web Pages

Let's take a look at what I have on GitHub so far:

- My original `.md` files in Spanish
- The `.md` files translated into English and German by AI
- The `.html` pages generated by Pandoc for all `.md` files.

The only thing missing now is a web server. And you can set that up from GitHub by going to the repository's CI/CD settings.

This will create a file in `.github/workflows/static.yml`, of which I only had to change the `runner`, because `runs-on: ubuntu-latest` wasn't working. I changed it to `runs-on: ubuntu-22.04` and upon committing, the pages were automatically served.

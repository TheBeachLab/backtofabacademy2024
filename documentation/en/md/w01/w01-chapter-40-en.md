## Project Management
I'd like to explain how I manage my projects. When you have no boss, and no one tells you what to do, you need to be very disciplined. Otherwise, you might fall into a negative spiral.

The most important thing is **knowing where you're headed**. Because if you don't, you have a very serious problem. Sometimes you'll find yourself lost in the Fab Academy (and in your life). You won't know what you want to do, you won't feel like doing anything, and it seems like you're moving in slow motion while the world speeds past you. When that happens, remember [Phil Stutz](https://www.thetoolsbook.com). Invest in yourself: Exercise, reconnect with other people, write your memories in a journal. It helps me, and I'm convinced it will help you too. Soon, you'll see your North Star. Head towards it.

The second thing is **learning to reduce and simplify**. One of your biggest problems in Fab Academy will be similar to this: You can't find a photo you're sure you had. You don't know if it's in your phone's photos, on Google Drive, or on a USB drive, if you moved it to a folder on your computer, or if someone sent it to you on WhatsApp... Simplify. Reduce.

And lastly, and I believe most importantly, the real secret to achieving anything, no matter how difficult it is, is to make **many small steps**. Solve a small problem, then another, and then another one. That's how it works.

In terms of tools to help you manage, I've tried a few. So I'll start with the ones that don't work for me:

- Post-it notes on the wall. The idea is good. Very visual and agile. But it has two problems. First problem: In Barcelona, it's often very hot, and the notes fall off. Second problem: If I can't see the wall, there's no project.
- Kanban-style software and similar. They try to mimic Post-it notes. I don't use them because: They seem complicated and don't let me draw.
- Microsoft Project and similar. No comment.
- Web services like Notion.com, Monday.com, and similar. I refuse to spend a single second of my short life trying to understand how a service that only looks easy on TikTok and will probably shut down tomorrow afternoon works.

Now, I'm using a combination of plain text for long-term goals, reminders for medium-term goals, and Apple's Freeform for tasks I'm going to do today. Freeform is an app with an infinite canvas, similar to [Miro](https://miro.com). It has the advantages of Post-it notes without their disadvantages. I can customize it and create my own system. For example, I've created the `DOING NOW` box where only one note fits. This is important to me because I can only do one thing at a time. I can also draw by hand, and I like that. I'll probably make a video explaining everything in more detail.

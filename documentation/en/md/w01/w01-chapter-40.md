## Project Management
[I'd like to dedicate a few lines]{.smallcaps} to explain how I manage my projects[^401]. When you don't have a boss, and nobody tells you what to do, you have to be very disciplined. Otherwise, you might fall into a negative spiral.

[^401]: Don't let anyone tell you how to manage a project. It's something very personal and you have to create your own system.

The most important thing is **knowing where you're going**. Because if you don't, you've got a serious problem. Sometimes you'll find yourself lost in Fab Academy (and in your life). You don't know what you want to do, you don't feel like doing anything, and it seems like you're moving in slow motion while the world races by. When that happens, remember [Phil Stutz](https://www.thetoolsbook.com). Invest in yourself: Exercise, connect with others, write in a journal. It helps me and I'm convinced it will help you too. Soon, you'll see your North Star. Head towards it.

Second is **learning to reduce and simplify**. One of your biggest problems in Fab Academy will be something like this: You can't find a photo that you're sure you had. You don't know if it's in your phone's photos, on Google Drive, or on a USB drive, if you moved it to your computer's folder, or if someone gave it to you on WhatsApp... Simplify. Reduce.

And lastly, and I think most importantly, the real secret to achieving anything, no matter how difficult, is by taking **many, very small steps**. You solve a small problem, then another, and then another. That's how it works.

As for tools to help you manage, I've tried a few. So I'll start with the ones that don't work for me:

- Post-it notes on the wall. The idea is good. Very visual and quick. But it has two problems. First problem: In Barcelona, it's usually very hot and the notes fall off. Second problem: If I can't see the wall, there's no project.
- Kanban-like software and similar. They try to mimic Post-it notes. I don't use them because: I find them complicated and they don't let me draw.
- Microsoft Project and the like. No comment.
- Web services like Notion.com, Monday.com, and similar. I'm not going to spend a second of my short life trying to understand how a service that only seems easy on TikTok (and will probably shut down tomorrow afternoon) works.

Now, I'm using a combination of plain text for long-term goals, reminders for medium-term goals, and Apple's Freeform for the tasks I'm going to do today. Freeform is a program with an infinite canvas, similar to [Miro](https://miro.com). It has the advantages of Post-it notes without their drawbacks. I can customize it and create my own system. For example, I've created the `DOING NOW` box where only one note fits. For me, that's important because I can only do one thing at a time. I can also draw by hand, and I like that. I'll probably make a video explaining everything in more detail.

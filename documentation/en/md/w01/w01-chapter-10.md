## My Environment

### macOS again? How did I sink this low?
Let me figure out how to explain this... Better yet, I'll explain it in a video[^101].

[^101]: Coming soon on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKDpiLmgp6Evt30dhHgRlcB80OhMfcs2W) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thebeachlab).

### My keyboard is weird
[While working on organizing Fab15 in Egypt]{.smallcaps}, I noticed Sherry Lassiter typing at lightning speed without looking at the keyboard. At that time, I typed with two fingers and always looked at the keyboard. So, I decided to learn. There's an advantage when you learn something from scratch – you have no bad habits. So, I didn't learn the QWERTY system, which was originally designed to prevent old typewriters from jamming. I learned with the [Colemak](https://colemak.com)[^102] system. I have an [ortho-linear keyboard](https://drop.com/buy/preonic-mechanical-keyboard) with a Colemak layout, and I practice for about five minutes a day.

[^102]: Colemak is designed so that the most frequently used letters in the English language are on the middle row.

![What I like the most about the Colemak layout is that the delete key is to the left of the `A` key](../../img/w01/preonic.webp)

I also have a [software on macOS](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org) that switches my keyboard layout to Colemak and also changes the function of the caps lock key[^104] to backspace.

[^104]: In reality, I only used it to insult

### My text editor is also weird
[My intention is to use only `vim`]{.smallcaps}, a command-line text editor. I have some knowledge of `vim` and I want to dive deeper into learning it. I like the idea of using only the keyboard to edit text. To avoid the temptation of using Visual Studio Code, I have uninstalled it[^103]. The vim text editor is quite sparse by default. That's why I have installed some plugins. Here is a list that I will expand over time:

[^103]: Just kidding, I only removed the shortcut.

- [→ NERDTree](https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree) to have a sidebar with a file listing, so you can navigate quickly between files.
- [→ vim-devicons](https://github.com/ryanoasis/vim-devicons) to visualize files and folders with a small graphic icon. 

 Other useful links:

- [→ VimAwesome](https://vimawesome.com) is a website with hundreds of vim plugins
- [→ Fran's My Computing repo](https://github.com/TheBeachLab/myComputing) with some tricks, in case you like using[^105] the command line.

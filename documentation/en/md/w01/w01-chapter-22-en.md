### Saving Time by Dictating
Most of the text you're reading has been dictated **in Spanish** into a Markdown text file. The reason I don't directly dictate it in English is because my accent is so bad that the computer fails to understand me. For dictation, I'm using macOS's dictation tool.

I really like this tool because:

- It works everywhere on the operating system, including the terminal.
- It allows you to speak and pause for up to 30 seconds without disconnecting.
- You can edit the text while dictating.
- You can add emojis ðŸ˜Š
- It adds punctuation automatically, and you can also do it manually.
- You can also change lines and paragraphs by saying so.
- If your processor is Apple Silicon, it understands context and autocorrects. All of this offline.
- I can use it while listening to music with my headphones.

Here is the complete list of commands in [Spanish](https://support.apple.com/es-es/guide/mac-help/mh40695/14.0/mac/14.0), [English](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh40695/14.0/mac/14.0), and [German](https://support.apple.com/de-de/guide/mac-help/mh40695/14.0/mac/14.0). This saves me some time when writing. I have to type some parts manually, for instance, when writing code or including links. I also have to make some manual corrections.

## Git: That Bottomless Pit
[You might think that]{.smallcaps} since I've been using git for 10 years I know everything there is to know about the version control system. Not at all. Here are the things I want to improve during this Fab Academy cycle:

- Curb my tendency to push changes to the main branch. Usually, it's fine, but I need to get into the habit of creating a new branch for each change.
- ~~Steal~~ Get inspired by [Neil's aliases](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/project_management/archive.html) to run git commands more quickly.

(I might add more stuff throughout Fab Academy...)

### Using CD/CI on Github to Serve Web Pages

Let's check out what I've got on Github so far:

- My original `.md` files in Spanish
- The `.md` files translated to English and German by AI
- The `.html` pages generated by Pandoc from all `.md` files.

The only thing missing now is a web server. And you can set that up on Github by going to the repository settings.

This will create a file named `.github/workflows/static.yml`. I only had to modify the `runner` because `runs-on: ubuntu-latest` wasn't working. I switched it to `runs-on: ubuntu-22.04` and upon committing, the pages were automatically served.

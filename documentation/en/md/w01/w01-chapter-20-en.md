## Reinventing My Documentation Process
I have to be realistic. I don't have much free time, and soon I'll have even less. So, I need a system to quickly write documentation. I'm going to try out a new system for documenting. As an unexpected benefit, this system will allow me to have the documentation in two (or more) languages.

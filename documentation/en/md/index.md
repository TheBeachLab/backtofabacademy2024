# About me
[My name is Fran Sanchez]{.smallcaps}, I'm the founder of [The (fabulous) Beach Lab](http://beachlab.org), a personal and mobile Fab Lab based in Sitges, Spain. I'm a Civil Engineering graduate with diverse passions: I love adventures and exploration. I often escape to the mountains in a 4x4, far from civilization, whenever I can. In pursuit of gaining a bit more range of motion, I became a ship captain, then a diver, and finally a pilot. I'm also a Radio Amateur Operator (EA3IRP) to meet people who aren't glued to their "smartphones" all day. I'm debating between submarines or helicopters for my next adventure. I also adore Unix-type computers (anything that runs in a terminal), Art, and Science. Yes, all this is very cool, but I wasn't making money, so I also became an Apple developer and now I also develop applications in Swift/SwiftUI for iOS devices. But I'm still not making any money.

# Expectations vs Reality

Here are my goals and expectations for this cycle.

## Expectations (written on January 19)

- I'm really excited to explore the limits of cutting-edge advancements.
- Since this is my second iteration of the Fab Academy, I expect the output of each week to be a product[^901].
- I want to brush off my knowledge in structural engineering, fluid mechanics, and differential geometry and put it into practice.
- I hope to be able to create or modify an AI model to generate some parts of the Fab Academy.
- I aim to complete a somewhat ambitious final project that I've had in mind for some time now.

I just reread my expectations, and I am already regretting them. But I am committed to not keeping them.

[^901]: A *product* understood as something finished enough to potentially hit the market.

## Reality (we'll see on June 5)

- Space reserved for a long list of miserable failures.

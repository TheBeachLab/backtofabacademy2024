# Expectations vs Reality

Here are my goals and expectations for this cycle.

## Expectations (written on January 19)

- I'm really excited to explore the limits of cutting-edge advancements.
- Since this is my second iteration of the Fab Academy, I expect the output of each week to be a product[^901].
- I want to brush off my knowledge in structural engineering, fluid mechanics, and differential geometry and put it into practice.
- I hope to be able to create or modify an AI model to generate some parts of the Fab Academy.
- I aim to complete a somewhat ambitious final project that I've had in mind for some time now.

I just reread my expectations, and I am already regretting them. But I am committed to not keeping them.

[^901]: A *product* understood as something finished enough to potentially hit the market.

## Reality (we'll see on June 5)

- Space reserved for a long list of miserable failures.

## About Me
My name is Fran Sanchez, I'm the founder of [The (fabulous) Beach Lab](http://beachlab.org), a personal and mobile Fab Lab based in Sitges, Spain. I'm a Civil Engineer with multiple passions: I love adventures and exploration, which is why I enjoy overlanding far from civilization. To gain a bit more range of movement, I became a boat captain, then a diver, and finally, a pilot. I'm also a Ham Radio Operator (EA3IRP) to meet people who aren't glued to their smartphones all day. I'm torn between submarines and helicopters for my next adventure. I also love Unix computers (anything that runs in a terminal), Art, and Science. Yes, all of this sounds great, but it wasn't making me money, so I also became an Apple developer and now I also develop apps in Swift/SwiftUI for iOS devices. But I'm still not making money.

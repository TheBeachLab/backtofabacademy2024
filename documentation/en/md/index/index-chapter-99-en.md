## Expectations vs Reality

Here are my goals and expectations for this cycle.

### Expectations (written on January 19)
- I'm really looking forward to pushing the boundaries every week.
- Since this is my second run of the Fab Academy, I'm hoping that the outcome of each week will be a product.
- I want to brush off my knowledge in structural engineering, fluid mechanics, and differential geometry and put it into practice.
- I hope to be able to create or modify an AI model to generate some parts of the tasks.
- I hope to complete a somewhat ambitious final project that I've had in mind for some time.

I just reread my expectations, and I'm already regretting them. But I'm committed to not changing them.

### Reality (to be written on June 5)

- Placeholder for a long list of miserable failures.

# About me
[My name is Fran Sanchez]{.smallcaps}, I'm the founder of [The (fabulous) Beach Lab](http://beachlab.org), a personal and mobile Fab Lab based in Sitges, Spain. I'm a Civil Engineering graduate with diverse passions: I love adventures and exploration. I often escape to the mountains in a 4x4, far from civilization, whenever I can. In pursuit of gaining a bit more range of motion, I became a ship captain, then a diver, and finally a pilot. I'm also a Radio Amateur Operator (EA3IRP) to meet people who aren't glued to their "smartphones" all day. I'm debating between submarines or helicopters for my next adventure. I also adore Unix-type computers (anything that runs in a terminal), Art, and Science. Yes, all this is very cool, but I wasn't making money, so I also became an Apple developer and now I also develop applications in Swift/SwiftUI for iOS devices. But I'm still not making any money.

## Broadcasting Fran's Chronicles from the Fab Academy 2024 at the `Pirate Node`

# About Me
My name is Fran Sanchez, and I am the founder of [The (fabulous) Beach Lab](http://beachlab.org), a personal and mobile Fab Lab based in Sitges, Spain. I am a Civil Engineering graduate with multiple passions: I love adventures and exploration, which is why I enjoy overlanding far from civilization. To gain a bit more range of motion, I became a boat captain, then a diver, and finally a pilot. I am also an Amateur Radio Operator (EA3IRP) to meet people who are not glued to their "smartphones" all day. I'm torn between submarines and helicopters for my next adventure. I also love Unix-type computers (anything that runs in a terminal), Art, and Science. Yes, all this is very nice, but it wasn't making me money, so I also became an Apple developer, and now I also develop applications in Swift/SwiftUI for iOS devices. But I'm still not making money.

## Expectations vs Reality

Here are my goals and expectations for this cycle.

### Expectations (written on January 19)
- I am eager to explore the limits every week.
- Since this is my second iteration of Fab Academy, I expect the result of each week to be a product.
- I want to shake off the rust from my knowledge in structural engineering, fluid mechanics, and differential geometry and put them into practice.
- I hope to be able to create or modify an AI model to generate some parts of the tasks.
- I hope to be able to complete a somewhat ambitious final project that I have had in mind for some time.

I just reread my expectations, and I'm already regretting them. But I am committed to not changing them.

### Reality (to be written on June 5)

- Placeholder for a long list of abject failures.

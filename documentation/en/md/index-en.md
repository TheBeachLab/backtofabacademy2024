## About Me
My name is Fran Sanchez, I'm the founder of [The (fabulous) Beach Lab](http://beachlab.org), a personal and mobile Fab Lab based in Sitges, Spain. I'm a Civil Engineer with a wide range of passions: I love adventures and explorations, which is why I enjoy overlanding far from civilization. To extend my range of motion, I became a ship captain, then a diver, and finally a pilot. I'm also a Ham Radio Operator (EA3IRP) to meet people who aren't glued to their "smartphones" all day long. I'm torn between submarines and helicopters for my next adventure. I also love Unix-type computers (anything that runs in a terminal), Art, and Science. Yes, all of this sounds great, but it wasn't making me money, so I also became an Apple developer, and now I develop applications in Swift/SwiftUI for iOS devices. But I'm still not making money.

## Expectations vs Reality

Here are my goals and expectations for this cycle.

### Expectations (written on January 19)
- I'm really looking forward to pushing the boundaries every week.
- Since this is my second run of the Fab Academy, I'm hoping that the outcome of each week will be a product.
- I want to brush off my knowledge in structural engineering, fluid mechanics, and differential geometry and put it into practice.
- I hope to be able to create or modify an AI model to generate some parts of the tasks.
- I hope to complete a somewhat ambitious final project that I've had in mind for some time.

I just reread my expectations, and I'm already regretting them. But I'm committed to not changing them.

### Reality (to be written on June 5)

- Placeholder for a long list of miserable failures.

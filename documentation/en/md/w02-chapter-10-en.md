## Weekly Goals

Last week was off to a bad start. I barely had time to do anything. I forgot that I never follow the advice I give. This week, I'm going to be more disciplined. The first thing I'm going to do is define what I want to accomplish and set a deadline for it. This is one of my favorite weeks because **I love trying out new software**. In order of preference, I'm going to:

- **OpenFOAM. Dedicate 1 day**
  - I want to learn how to create geometries in Blender.
  - I want to do a simulation of an airfoil section.
  - I want to perform a simulation of incompressible fluid.
  - I want to learn how to visualize results in Paraview.
- **FreeCAD. Dedicate 1 day**. I have a love-hate relationship with FreeCAD. I use it, I hate it, then I miss it, I use it again, and then I hate it again. I'm going to see if I can fall in love with [Ondsel](https://ondsel.com). Specifically, these are the things I'd like to do this week:
  - Try all the tools again to see if they've improved.
  - Test the Assembly Workbench.
  - Try out TechDraw Workbench.
  - Conduct a simulation in Calculix.
  - I hope to integrate some hardware device to control parameters.
  - I'm looking forward to installing and trying out the `OSH Automated Documentation` add-on by [Pieter Hijma](https://pieterhijma.net/index.html).
- **Blender. Dedicate 2 days**. I have a lot of work here.
  - Learn as much as I can about Geometry Nodes.
  - Real-time rendering with EEVEE.
  - Control a virtual camera with a phone.
  - Create a physical simulation.
  - Create an animation with Grease Pencil.
  - Explore Blender's serial port interface.
- **JavaScript. Dedicate 1 day**
  - I want to use ThreeJS to visualize 3D models on the webpage.
  - I want to learn more about D3JS for data visualizations and cartography.
- **Artificial Intelligence. Dedicate 1 day**
  - Explore the state of generative 3D models
  - Read the article about generating 3D models from large language models (LLM).
  - Use Midjourney or similar to generate some images for the final project.
- **Command-line. Dedicate 1/2 day**
  - I'm going to integrate Imagemagick into the documentation generation scripts to automate image compression.
  - I'm also going to integrate ffmpeg into scripts for video compression.
- **Audio. Dedicate 1/2 day**
  - I'm going to take some time to learn a bit about Sonic Pi.

I think I've overreached. If I manage to do 1/4 of it, I'll be happy.

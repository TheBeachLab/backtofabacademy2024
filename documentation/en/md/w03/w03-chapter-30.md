# Flexible Mechanisms
This week I'm spending a good chunk of my time learning about flexible mechanisms. These mechanisms apply a lot of the theoretical knowledge from structural analysis that I studied, only instead of avoiding structural failures, the goal here is to control the effects of the failure. Any structural engineer gets goosebumps when they hear the word *buckling*[^301]. But here, I'm supposed to be happy about it.

[^301]:
    A structural failure that occurs when a slender column is subjected to compression.

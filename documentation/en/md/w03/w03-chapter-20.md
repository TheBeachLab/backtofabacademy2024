# Cutting "something" on the vinyl cutter
[The vinyl cutter is my preferred machine]{.smallcaps}. It's versatile, fast, clean, emits no smoke or vapors, and requires no chemicals.

In the latest review, Neil mentioned wanting to see designs *for the final project*.\
→ not whatever you feel like\
→ not something random\
→ for the final project

Following that philosophy, I'm going to cut the logos of my projects. There are two reasons why all my projects have a name/brand.

1. The first reason is that I intend to commercialize them. In a few weeks, there's a class called *Invention, Intellectual Property, and Income*. Throughout many years following Fab Academy, I hear people completely ignoring that week, saying they "aren't motivated by commercial interest," they do it "for the love of art," "for the good of humanity." How lovely. Dear friends: As far as I know, you can't pay taxes with your final project, nor with courses for your community, nor with aquaponics lettuces. They only accept money.
2. The second reason I give a short name is that cutting is easy; the machine does it. But weeding the figure from the background with tweezers is torture, especially if the sticker is this:

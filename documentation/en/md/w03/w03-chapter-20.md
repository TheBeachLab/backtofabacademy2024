# Cutting "something" on the vinyl cutter
[The vinyl cutter is my favorite machine]{.smallcaps}. It's versatile, fast, clean, doesn't emit fumes or vapors, and doesn't require chemicals.

In the last review, Neil said he wanted to see designs *from the final project*.\
→ not what you feel like\
→ not something random\
→ from the final project

Following that philosophy, I'm going to cut the logos of my projects. There are two reasons why all my projects have a name/brand.

1. The first reason is that I intend to commercialize them. In a few weeks, there's a class called *Invention, Intellectual Property, and Income*. Over many years following the Fab Academy, I hear people who completely ignore that week saying they "have no commercial interest", they do it "for the love of art", "for the good of humanity". How nice. Dear friends: As far as I'm aware, you can't pay your taxes with your final project, nor with courses to your community, nor with aquaponics lettuces. They only accept money.
2. The second reason why I put a short name is because cutting is easy, the machine does it. But weeding the figure from the background with tweezers is torture, especially if the sticker is this:

# Week's Goals

[Last week started off on the wrong foot]{.smallcaps}. I barely had time to do anything.[^101] This week I'm going to be more disciplined. The first thing I'm doing is defining my goals and setting a deadline to achieve them. It's one of my favorite weeks because **I love trying out new software**. In order of preference, I'm planning to:

[^101]: I forgot that I never follow my own advice.

- **OpenFOAM. 1 day of dedication**
  - I want to learn how to create geometries in Blender.
  - I want to run a simulation of an airfoil.
  - I want to simulate incompressible flow.
  - I want to learn how to visualize results in Paraview.
- **FreeCAD. 1 day of dedication**. I have a love-hate relationship with FreeCAD. I use it, I hate it, then I miss it, I use it again, and then I hate it again. Let's see if I can fall in love with [Ondsel](https://ondsel.com) this time. Specifically, here's what I'd like to do this week:
  - Give all the tools another try to see if theyâ€™ve improved.
  - Test out the Assembly Workbench.
  - Try the TechDraw Workbench.
  - Run a simulation in Calculix.
  - I hope to integrate some hardware device to control parameters.
  - I aim to install and test the add-on by [Pieter Hijma](https://pieterhijma.net/index.html) `OSH Automated Documentation`.
- **Blender. 2 days of dedication.** This is where I've got my work cut out for me.
  - Learn as much as I can about Geometry Nodes.
  - Real-time rendering with EEVEE.
  - Control a virtual camera with my phone.
  - Create a physics simulation.
  - Create an animation with Grease Pencil.
  - Explore Blender's serial port interface.
- **JavaScript. 1 day of dedication**
  - I want to use ThreeJS to visualize 3D models on the web page.
  - I want to learn more about D3JS for data visualizations and mapping.
- **Artificial Intelligence. 1 day of dedication**
  - Explore the status of generative models in 3D
  - Read the paper on generating 3D models from large language models (LLM).
  - Use Midjourney or something similar to generate some images for the final project.
- **Command line. 1/2 day of dedication**
  - I will integrate Imagemagick into the documentation generation scripts to automate image compression.
  - I will also integrate ffmpeg into the scripts for video compression.
- **Audio. 1/2 day of dedication**
  - I'm going to take some time to learn a bit about Sonic Pi.

I think I may have overdone it. If I manage to do 1/4 of this, I'll be more than happy.

# Conclusions
[*under development*]{.mark .yellow}

[Participants of Fab Academy are heroes]{.smallcaps}[^901]. I had completely forgotten how tough the course is. I admit it's been a challenge for me. It's Sunday, and I've accomplished less than 5% of what I had planned. Moreover, I keep making changes to the template, and when I fix one thing, I break another.

[^901]: Instructors are heroes too. Especially those from [Puebla](https://fabacademy.org/2024/labs/puebla/).

I'm glad to be participating again as a student. I still smile from the back row when you're called to the board, but not as much. I'm more human. This experience will improve my social skills as an instructor[^902].

I'm particularly proud of putting into practice engineering skills I thought I had forgotten. Fab Academy has been the motivation I needed. I believe that combining these competencies with the power of AI, amazing results can be achieved.

[^902]: I have a somewhat peculiar educational style. You could say I'm more like [Homelander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelander) than Superman.

# Conclusions
[*under development*]{.mark .yellow}

[Fab Academy participants are heroes]{.smallcaps}[^901]. I had completely forgotten how tough the course is. I admit it's been challenging for me. It's Sunday and I haven't achieved even 5% of what I had planned. Moreover, I keep making changes to the template and when I fix something, I break another.

[^901]: Instructors are heroes too. Especially those from [Puebla](https://fabacademy.org/2024/labs/puebla/).

I'm glad to be participating again as a student. I'm still smiling from the back row when you all go up to the board, but not as much. I'm more human. This experience will improve my social skills as an instructor[^902].

I'm particularly proud of putting into practice engineering skills I thought I had forgotten. Fab Academy has been the motivation I needed. I believe that combining these competencies with the power of AI can achieve incredible results.

[^902]: My educational style is somewhat peculiar. You could say I'm more like [Homelander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelander) than Superman.

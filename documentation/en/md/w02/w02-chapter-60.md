# Artificial Intelligence

[We've made progress, but we still have a long way to go]{.smallcaps}. Today, February 5, 2024, I asked the 4 most well-known artificial intelligences (ChatGPT 3.5, ChatGPT4 Turbo, Bing, and Bard) to do something very simple:

[^601] <center>*Draw an Ikigai diagram in TikZ*</center>
I have two observations and one conclusion: The first observation is that **none** of the 4 intelligences did a good job. The second observation, also interesting, is that **it is indistinguishable** which one is especially better than the others. Despite some models being technically superior to others. The conclusion, therefore, is that it seems clear that the "artificial" intelligences have **little to no reasoning ability** in areas where they have not been trained. Even knowing the rules for creating the diagram, they were incapable of drawing 4 circles and a few labels.

Interestingly, Bard (Gemini Pro model) couldn't even generate correct code. I had to pass Bard's code to Bing to have it corrected. Supposedly Bing is ChatGPT4, but I think that copy came out blurry. These models need a large amount of training data to recognize patterns; they do not reason in the human sense. I could have spent the entire afternoon trying to get the models to move the circles to their correct positions. There are people who do that, but I find it absurd. There's a huge effort to achieve General AI capable of reasoning like a human. However, for now, we'll have to continue training the models in the areas we want. That's one of my goals at Fab Academy.

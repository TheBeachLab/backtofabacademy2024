[The Navier-Stokes equation]{.smallcaps} is a set of partial differential equations that describe fluid motion. In vector form and in a three-dimensional coordinate system, the Navier-Stokes equations for an incompressible fluid are:

\[
\rho \left( \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{v} \right) = -\nabla p + \mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{v} + \rho \mathbf{g}
\]

where:

- \(\rho\) is fluid density,
- \(\mathbf{v}\) is the fluid velocity vector,
- \(t\) is time,
- \(p\) is pressure,
- \(\mu\) is the fluid's dynamic viscosity,
- \(\nabla\) is the nabla operator,
- \(\nabla^2\) is the Laplacian,
- \(\mathbf{g}\) is the vector of acceleration due to gravity.

This equation describes the conservation of momentum and the relationship between pressure, viscosity, and fluid acceleration. Solving these equations can be complex, especially in nonlinear or turbulent situations. If the fluid is compressible, things get a bit more complicated because \(\rho\) is not constant but can vary in time and space.

\[
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v}) = 0
\]

These equations cannot be solved analytically; numerical methods must be used. That's where [OpenFOAM](https://openfoam.org)[^201], an open-source suite for numerical fluid simulations, comes in. OpenFOAM doesn't have a graphical interface. All files, including the geometry, initial conditions, boundary conditions, model, etc., are introduced via text files[^203].

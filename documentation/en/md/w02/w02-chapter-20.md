[The Navier-Stokes Equation]{.smallcaps} is a set of partial differential equations that describe the motion of fluids. In vector form, and in a three-dimensional coordinate system, the Navier-Stokes equations for an incompressible fluid are:

\[
\rho \left( \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{v} \right) = -\nabla p + \mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{v} + \rho \mathbf{g}
\]

where:

- \(\rho\) is the fluid density,
- \(\mathbf{v}\) is the fluid velocity vector,
- \(t\) is time,
- \(p\) is the pressure,
- \(\mu\) is the fluid dynamic viscosity,
- \(\nabla\) is the nabla operator,
- \(\nabla^2\) is the Laplacian,
- \(\mathbf{g}\) is the acceleration vector due to gravity.

This equation describes the conservation of momentum and the relationship between pressure, viscosity, and fluid acceleration. Solving these equations can be complex, especially in nonlinear or turbulent situations. If the fluid is compressible, things get a bit more complicated because \(\rho\) is no longer constant but can vary over time and space.

\[
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v}) = 0
\]

These equations cannot be solved analytically; numerical methods are required. That's where [OpenFOAM](https://openfoam.org)[^201], a set of open-source programs for the numerical simulation of fluids[^202], comes in. OpenFOAM does not have a graphical interface. All files, including the geometry, initial conditions, boundary conditions, model, etc., are introduced through text files[^203].

Fran’s Fab Academy Chronicles 2024 from the

<h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Fran Sanchez, and I am the founder of <a
href="http://beachlab.org">The (fabulous) Beach Lab</a>, a personal and
mobile Fab Lab based in Sitges, Spain. I am a Civil Engineer with
multiple passions: I love adventures and exploration, which is why I
enjoy overlanding far from civilization. To gain a bit more range of
movement, I became a boat captain, then a diver, and finally a pilot. I
am also a Ham Radio Operator (EA3IRP) to meet people who are not glued
to their “smartphones” all day. I am torn between submarines and
helicopters for my next adventure. I also love Unix-type computers
(anything that runs in a terminal), Art, and Science. Yes, all of this
is very nice, but I was not making money, so I also became an Apple
Developer and now I also develop applications for iOS devices. But I’m
still not making money. Check out my travel utility, <a

<p>Final Project</p>
<h2 id="expectations-vs-reality">Expectations vs Reality</h2>
<p>These are my goals and expectations for this course.</p>
<h3 id="expectations-written-on-january-19">Expectations (written on
January 19)</h3>
<ul>
<li>I am looking forward to exploring the boundaries each week.</li>
<li>Since this is my second iteration of Fab Academy, I expect the
result of each week to be a product.</li>
<li>I want to brush up my knowledge in structural engineering, fluid
mechanics, and differential geometry and put them into practice.</li>
<li>I hope to be able to create or modify an AI model to generate some
parts of the tasks.</li>
<li>I am hoping to be able to complete a somewhat ambitious final
project that I have had in mind for some time.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have just reread my expectations, and I am already regretting them.
But I am committed to not changing them.</p>
<h3 id="reality-to-be-written-on-june-5">Reality (to be written on June
5)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Space reserved for a long list of miserable failures.</li>
</ul>

In [2013](https://fabacademy.org/archives/2013/students/sanchez.francisco/index.html) I took Fab Academy[^1] Class at Fab Lab Barcelona, a life changing experience. Since then I have been instructor in the program, member of the global eval and member of the assessment committee. Now, a decade later, I'm embarking on a revisit of this journey, approaching the course again from a participant's viewpoint. The curriculum has evolved with new topics, lots of AI coming up. I won't actively participate in the class or undergo evaluation. But otherwise I am identical to any other student in the course. Ready?

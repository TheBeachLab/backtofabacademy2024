# Back to Fab Academy 2024

In 2013 I took Fab Academy Class in Fab Lab Barcelona, a life changing experience. Since then I have been instructor in the program, member of the global eval and member of the assessment committee. Now, a decade later, I'm embarking on a revisit of this journey, approaching the course again from a participant's viewpoint. The curriculum has evolved with new topics, lots of AI coming up. I won't actively participate in the class or undergo evaluation. But otherwise I am identical to any other student in the course. Ready?
